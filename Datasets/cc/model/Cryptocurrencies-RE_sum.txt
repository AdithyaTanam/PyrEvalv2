In a 2018 news article ‘Tech Tent: Has crypto-currency peaked?’, Rory Cellan-Jones discusses the future of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum.
He notes how the crypto-currency burst dropped the value of crypto-currencies down by 80%.
Despite this, more and more businesses are adopting crypto-currency as a payment method.
For example, an art gallery in London held an exhibition with digital currencies as the preferred payment method.
With the help of a few experts, he also implies that if businesses keep jumping onto supporting crypto-currency, it will survive.
However, with the recent bubble burst, a lot of the trust in them has disappeared.
This includes the transaction issues, such as going through slowly or not at all.
Bitcoin, however, has an advantage of wielding a strong support from people who are into it, enabling it to survive from crisis that may have killed off any ‘normal’ financial system.
