Rory Cellan-Jones talks about the current state of crypto-currencies, in the September 2018 BBC article entitled, “Tech Tent: Has crypto-currency peaked?” He suggests that the crypto-currency has hit its peak in popularity.
Cellan-Jones suggests that since Ethereum (a Bitcoin rival) is now eighty percent lower than its peak, that this could suggest the currencies are failing.
Cellan-Jones then goes on to counter this argument, by suggesting that a London art gallery and Scottish hotel chain plan to introduce support for different crypto-currencies.
It was first believed that the London based art gallery would use only crypto-currencies, this was later revised to encourage people to use crypto-currencies.
Cellan-Jones spoke to David Gerard, the author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain, he said this issue with crypto-currencies is their lack of acceptance in many different places and just how volatile they are.
Christopher Shake, the director of the London art gallery, suggests that this is not the case and that many different companies of different natures (not just technology related) are getting involved with crypto-currencies.
