In the fast moving and highly adaptive digital age that we reside in, it comes as no surprise that a new form of currency has developed and evolved into what is known as cryptocurrencies.
With the founding and usage of these new digital currencies, many questions have arisen regarding the strength, value, stability and future of these new trade methods.
Even with these questions, there are still many that have faith in digital currencies, with people and businesses still working towards a wider acceptance and usability of this medium.
Cellan-Jones (2018) writes “recent days both a London art gallery and a Scottish hotel have contacted me about plans to allow their customers to pay with crypto-currencies.” This is proof that some people are still working towards the age of cryptocurrencies, or at least an age in which they are incorporated into daily life with less restraint from the standard banking systems.
However, contradicting his point, these questions going unanswered due to no person or organisation being able to confidently provide solid and supported answers, cryptocurrencies have been volatile at best in its recent history; the current unstable state leading to an uncertain future.
