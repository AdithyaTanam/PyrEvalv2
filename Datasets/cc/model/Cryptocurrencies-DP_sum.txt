The BBC News online article “Has crypto-currency peaked?” by Rory Cellan-Jones (2018) Warns those looking to the future of cryptocurrency, offering the staggering statistic that Ethereum, Bitcoins main rival within the crypto marketplace is 80% below its peak.
Cellan-Jones writes that Businesses located in London and Scotland have made enquiries to allow payment from customers using cryptocurrencies.
It is suggested that if more businesses start to accept cryptocurrencies then this will in turn create confidence in the crypto market.
The main reason offered for the lack of market take up is the sheer volatility in value coupled with troublesome transaction processes, stating that in some cases transactions were slow and often didn’t complete at all.
Gallery director and cryptocurrency supporter Christopher Shake was hoping to host the first exhibition where payment was only available via cryptocurrency.
However, before the exhibition the gallery had changed its position to one that would encourage payment in cryptocurrency in the first instance and accept more traditional methods as an alternative.
It is pointed out that a motivation for this approach is based upon the belief that people are sitting on large crypto assets and are unable to spend them.
Within the article the other side of the argument is presented from David Gerard and his belief that cryptocurrency has had its time, he tempers this by saying he does not feel it will disappear overnight, instead becoming more regulated and normalised, essentially a different vision from the original early bitcoin.
