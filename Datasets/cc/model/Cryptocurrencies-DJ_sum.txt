There have been some recent setbacks for crypto currencies as “US regulators have acted against companies involved in crypto-currencies” <REF> and as such has led to the Ethereum dropping to 80% below its peak value.
However, there has been some positive news as businesses such as a Scottish Hotel and a London Art Gallery are allowing customers to pay with crypto-currencies.
The art gallery in question claimed to be the world’s first exhibition to be available only through crypto-currency, however this soon changed to encouraging people to use crypto-currencies while allowing other forms of payment.
The owner of the gallery explained that he wanted to solve a problem with crypto-currencies which is “people sitting on big crypto assets aren't able to spend them.” Author David Gerard’s opinion is that crypto-currencies aren’t being adopted because it doesn’t offer what was promised, as smooth cost-free transactions turned out to be slow and often didn’t work.
