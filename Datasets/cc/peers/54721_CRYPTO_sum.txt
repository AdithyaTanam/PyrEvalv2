A crypto-currency enthusiast, explains that there is a problem that would like to solve: people sitting on large assets of crypto-currency but they are not able to spend them.
While, the US regulators acted against the companies involved in cryptocurrencies and initial offers of coins (ICO) - schemes to create new coins.
If you believe that the crypto-currencies are the future, this has not been a good time.
If many traders come forward and accept cryptocurrencies, this will add confidence to the market.
The gallery's press release boasted that it was going to publish "the first art exhibition available only through the crypto-currency".
In the last few days both a London art gallery and a Scottish hotel have contacted about plans to allow their customers to pay with cryptocurrencies.
The value of Ethereum, the main rival of Bitcoin and "the future of crypto" not so long ago, has decreased lower and lower and is currently at the height of 80%.
But David Gerard says that things are moving in the opposite direction: fewer traders accept cryptocurrencies because they are so volatile and the promise of regular and cost-free transactions has proved illusory.
He claims that everyone from Goldman Sachs to Amazon and Facebook is turning into crypto-currencies - something that David Gerard says is not really the case - and he believes it is an idea whose time has come.
