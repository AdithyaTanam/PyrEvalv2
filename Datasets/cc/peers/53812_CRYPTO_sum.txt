In the BBC article “Tech Tent: Has crypto-currency peaked?” there have been several views from Christopher Shake and David Gerard concerning the future of cryptocurrency.
The article states that it has not been a good week due to the value of Ethereum dropping in value 80% below its peak.
Ethereum is Bitcoins main rival and a form of cryptocurrency.
Christopher Shake is the director of the London Gallery, The House of Fine Art.
According to his views he states that the currencies will stick around as they have good value and it’s a great technology overall.
Christopher Shake sees it completely different from David Gerard, he says that merchants such as Amazon and Facebook are investigating to make use of cryptocurrencies.
David Gerard is known as the main author of “Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain”.
Regarding his views cryptocurrencies are having several issues within the financial market.
For example, less merchants are accepting cryptocurrencies due to their volatility measures.
He said many people left during the 2017 Bitcoin bubble, because it could not be trusted as transitions were very slow and did not go through at times.
According to the article his views were summed up of the entire cryptocurrency market stating, “It’s not interesting or shiny anymore”, meaning its value is decreasing.
In addition, David does not see the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin disappearing any time soon.
His forecast states that the cryptocurrencies will gradually become more normalised and regulated.
There have been many drops in value and hacking situations with Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin that I will discuss from my research.
