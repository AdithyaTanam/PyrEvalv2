The article gives a good understanding of how cryptocurrency is performing at the moment.
The article shows different opinion of people “for” and “against” cryptocurrency.
It is stated in the article that bitcoin had reached to 80% fall, which shows the fall of crypto currency in the market.
In the very start the article doesn’t show any benefit of using cryptocurrency but instead it stated “If you believe crypto-currencies are the future this has not been a good week.” This statement represents that the article is totally against crypto currency.
The two main opponents “Christopher Shake” and “David Gerard” have different opinion on crypto currency.
Christopher Shake shares his opinion by saying "It is sticking around because it has value.” Whereas on the other hand David Gerrard is against crypto currency.
He says, “You couldn't trust it for volatility”.
These opinions shows a very strong argument but being a strong opponent “for” crypto currency Christopher Shake makes a sudden move and says that one can buy his art pieces for regular cash.
This statement indicates that he isn’t confident enough to stick to his main plan, which was to sell his pieces in crypto currency.
