Cryptocurrencies have made a huge noise during the past two years.
It all started off with Bitcoin which was one of the first cryptocurrencies to surface back in 2010.
If you were to purchase one Bitcoin during 2010 it would have cost £0.08.
Fast forward to December 2017 and 1 Bitcoin was worth over £15,0000.
However since then the currency has been dropping and has never reached that peak again.
Since Bitcoin arrived other crypto currencies have also surfaced like Ethereum and Litecoin.
Although they are also cryptocurrencies they are no where near worth the same amount as bitcoin.
