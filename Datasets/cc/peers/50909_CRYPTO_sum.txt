In an article written by Rory Cellan-Jones, he reports on a debate about cryptocurrency between self-confessed ‘crypto-enthusiast’ Mr. Christopher Shake who is the director of London’s’ The House of Fine Art gallery; and author David Gerard, who wrote “Attack of the 50 foot Blockchain”; a book which covers many crypto-related topics including the history of Bitcoin and the 2017 crypto bubble.
Shake speculates that if more merchants accept crypto as a convenient way to purchase goods, it will add confidence to the market; which is also the reason for his upcoming crypto-friendly art exhibition.
Shake claims global companies like Amazon and Facebook are now moving into accepting cryptocurrencies as valid methods of payment.
Gerard on the other hand, believes that due to its volatile nature, there is a lack of trust in cryptocurrency.
The slow and often incomplete transactions have also negatively influenced its acceptance into the general financial market.
However, Gerard also believes the crypto-currency market will become more regulated in the future.
A person/s only known by the pseudonym ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ created the first cryptocurrency ‘Bitcoin’.
Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has risen from a value of nothing to a peak of $17,900.

Bitcoin’s current value is approximately $6,200 (CoinDesk) which may seem like a shocking comparison, however, the cryptocurrency market already has a reputation for its volatility.
Sceptics could argue this is a major ‘red flag’, a substantial argument against the longevity and reliability of E-currency.
