In this summary I will be summarising all the key factors that are presented in the article about Crypto-currencies.
There are many concepts included, I also will be discussing if Crypto-currencies are the future or not.
What is Crypto-currency?
Crypto-currency is a digital computer interactive generated currency in which encryption techniques are used to adjust the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, it operates independently of a central bank; it isn’t controlled by the government.
It also is tax free and has no transaction fees when being used.
The article is based on wondering if Crypto-currencies have peaked or if it still has better days ahead, in addition to this bitcoin which is the largest Crypto-currency, this is what they're discussing in the article, “Due to the fact that the value of Bitcoin has lurched even lower and is now 80% below its peak”.
