On 14 September 2018 Rory Cellan-Jones published a BBC newsletter article asking ‘Has Crypto-currency peaked’?
In order to figure this out he invited David Gerrard (an author and blogger on crypto and Christopher Shake (Director of London gallery, The house of fine arts).
David Gerrard states that the main problem Crypto-currency is facing volatility.
This all started after the 2017 bitcoin bubble.
During this period transactions were very slow and most of the times did not even process through.
This ruined and slowed the progress of Crypto being accepted by companies/businesses because it was not being efficient.
Crypto was changing so much that you could not trust it and people are sitting on large crypto-assets but are not able to use them.
This led to fewer merchants using it because there was no confidence of smooth transactions happening.
Merchants left and this slowed down the use of crypto-currency.
If you compare its beginning to now it doesn’t seem that fun or exciting anymore.
However, merchants like Christopher Shake think the currency is the future.
At his museum he has introduced Crypto-currency and encourages more merchants like himself to accept the currency and give it a chance.
He states that bigger companies like Amazon, Facebook etc.
are slowly moving onto crypto.
Due to it just starting crypto won’t disappear anytime soon.
This is because despite it constantly facing issues it has gotten bigger and better every time.
This will lead to it being more used and normalized as time goes on.
