Tech Tent doesn’t seem to think so.
An article by Rory Cellen-Jones titled; ‘Tech Tent: Has crypto-currency peaked?’; which mainly looks at a debate - hosted by Tech Tent - between Christopher Shake whom spoke for cryptocurrencies as attractive to businesses, and David Gerard; who is ‘sceptical’ on the topic of cryptocurrency.
It also briefly goes over varying other reasons that cryptocurrency is in decline, one such reason being regulations against companies using cryptocurrencies in the US, which is likely to do with it’s ‘volitivity’ and unpredictable rises and drops in value.
So, is cryptocurrency failing?
Most of the points made in Cellen-Jones’ article does suggest that this is a fact.
Gerard has stated that ‘fewer merchants are accepting crypto-currencies’.
However, in a Forbes article by Michael del Castillo in June 6th, which informs of the top 10 companies using blockchains, these findings to not correlate with Gerard’s statement.
It seems that despite the volatility in value and slowness in transactions have not stopped JPMorgan, Apple and the ICBC (Industrial & Commercial Bank of China) from using blockchains.
However, several of the companies in this list have voiced opinions against cryptocurrency or are using them in ‘secret’.
This does mean that cryptocurrencies cannot be failing, if such large organisations are investing billions into Bitcoin and blockchains like Tzero.
Could this mean we could see cryptocurrencies being much more widely used by more famous organisations?
It is possible, given it’s increasing value and uses.
