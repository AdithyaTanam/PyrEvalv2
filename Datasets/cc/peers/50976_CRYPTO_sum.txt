In the summary, I will be discussing about the main concepts of the article, also I will be giving a brief report on cryptocurrency concerning if they are the future or not.
Cryptocurrency is a digital or computer-generated type of currency for which encryption methods are used to control its use and generate its release for security.
It is an innovative new form of currency that is being used to buy products and services.
This currency is decentralised (which means isn't secured to bank, or organised by a government).
“Furthermore, bitcoin (the largest cryptocurrency) has recently had a displeasing downfall in value and is now 80 per cent below its peak.” “However, some organisations have lined up plans to sanction customers to pay with crypto-currencies.” For example, “both a London art gallery and a Scottish hotel have been in talks about campaigns to allow customers to pay with crypto-currencies.”
