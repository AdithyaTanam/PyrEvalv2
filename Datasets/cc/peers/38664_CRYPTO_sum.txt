According to the BBC News article ‘Tech Tent: Has Crypto-currency Peaked?’ written by Rory Cellan-Jones, the likelihood of cryptocurrencies becoming the currencies of the future seems slim.
Even the title of the article alludes to this; suggesting that cryptocurrencies have already reached the peak of their attraction and that their popularity is on the decline.
This is further evidenced by the value of Ethereum, “the future of crypto” and rival to Bitcoin, which has dropped 80% below its peak.
This article features both Christopher Shake, a supporter of cryptocurrency, and David Gerard who remains sceptical of its future.
Shake, as the director a London art gallery, shows his support by accepting cryptocurrency at the gallery’s art exhibitions.
For Shake, cryptocurrencies need encouragement from merchants in order to thrive.
Gerard however, believes that merchants won’t accept cryptocurrencies due to their volatile nature and the fact that they are not the smooth cost-free transactions that they were promised to be.
After its initial introduction transactions proved to be slow and unreliable, often not going through at all and that this has led to merchants being reluctant to accept it as a currency.
However, despite his reservations, Gerard attests that cryptocurrencies will not disappear in a hurry and ‘his forecast is that they will slowly become more regulated and normalised.’ <REF>.
