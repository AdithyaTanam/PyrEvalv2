There are many different types of crypto-currencies around but how long will they be around for?
This debate has been around for many years since it was introduced in 2008.
The value of Ethereum which is Bitcoins main rival and “the future of crypto” as it was known as not so long ago has launched even lower and is now at 80% below its peak.
The US regulators have acted against companies that have been involved in crypto-currencies and its initial coin offerings (ICOs).
The London Art gallery and a Scottish hotel were both interested in planning to allow their customers to pay with Crypto-currencies.
The Gallery’s very own press had released boasting that they were about to run “the very first exhibition only available through crypto-currency”.
There has also been a forecast by David Gerrard suggesting that “crypto-currency will slowly become more regulated and normalised- a rather different vision from that of the early Bitcoin advocates, who saw it smashing the system and making the central banks and governments irrelevant”.
