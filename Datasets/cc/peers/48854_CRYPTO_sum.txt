The real-world application and merits of both cryptocurrency and the underlying technology are discussed in a sit-down debate between Christopher Shake, a cryptocurrency enthusiast London Gallery director and David Gerard, cryptocurrency sceptic and author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain.
The debate was spurred by Shake’s gallery offering works for sale exclusively for digital currency in an attempt to give confidence to merchants who may have been teasing the idea of accepting cryptocurrency as payment.
With this event Shake simultaneously addresses the main problem as he sees it.
Cryptocurrency is already out there and people that have either mined or acquired an amount of it have few viable outlets to spend it.
Gerard’s position is that cryptocurrencies and in particular Bitcoin has a strong following rooted in idealism.
He sees a world where perhaps within the framework of regulation cryptocurrencies co-exist with established systems of money.
He believes that really it is the underlying blockchain technology that will be the impetus for innovation and adoption from businesses.
There’s a fundamental agreement that the volatility in the value of cryptocurrency has been a factor in discouraging business adoption.
They differ greatly on how solve this problem though.
