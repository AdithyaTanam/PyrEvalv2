In this essay I will be discussing what cryptocurriences (cryto) are and what effect they have on conventional forms of curriencies and the implications they have.
The article I used to inform my argument was by the BBC and disscuses how ‘entherum’ a form of cryptocurrienies has reached an all time low in value.
The article discusses recent uses of crytocurriences in the world, such as an art exhibition to only be avalible through crytocurriences.
And explains how the issue with crytocuriences is that ‘people (are) sitting on big crypto assests aren’t able to spend them’ and a potential solution is if ‘merchants jump on and accept crypto-currencies’ however this doesn’t seem likely as David Gerard explains that merchants are just not willing to accept cyrpto as it is too volitile and the main selling point of ‘cost-free’ transaction is merely an illusion to Gerard.
Furtheron Christopher Shake thinks differently.
Shake believes that large companies are moving to crypto ‘from Goldman Sachs to Amazon and Facebook’ Shake insists that crypto is great technology and that it’s value outweighs its disadvantages.
Shake:  believes that crypto will be a standard and become less volatile.
