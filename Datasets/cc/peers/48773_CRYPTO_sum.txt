The BBC’s Rory Cellan-Jones has presented an informative article discussing the possibility that crypto-currency may become obsolete over the next few years.
This is due to a recent drop of the cryptocurrency “Ethereum”, which dropped to 80% lower than its peak.
Cellan-Jones gives two examples of businesses that have recently contacted him regarding their decision to allow payment via crypto-currency.
The manager of one of these businesses, Christopher Shake, joins him along with Crypto-sceptic, David Gerard, to discuss the future of crypto-currency.
Though the article is laid out as a formal debate, it reads more like a conversation, with one party stating their predictions or opinions and then the other offering theirs.
They are far from peers however, as Gerard is the author of the book “Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain” in which tackles this very issue, and Shake is merely an advocate for crypto-currency’s more widespread use.
Gerard argues that confidence in the market is at an all-time low and the currencies are “lurching from crisis to crisis”.
He believes that confidence to the market will be restored if “a lot of merchants” accept crypto-currencies as valid currency.
Shake states that “Our main goal is to support and promote our artists” as he feels that allowing payment via crypto currency will attract a wider audience, which subsequently means that his artists will receive more exposure, as well as business.
