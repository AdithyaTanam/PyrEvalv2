The rapid evolution of cryptocurrencies in recent years hasn't gone unnoticed.
More and more people are starting to take an interest in the subject and are starting to analyze the usefulness and convenience of using such currency in their daily lives in the near future.
Some vendors have started to accept the use of  cryptocurrencies as a paying method in exchange for their services and products.
But many people and places tend to avoid using them because they think "It's not really very interesting or shiny any more"<REF>, and also think that the worth of them has reached its 'peak' after the recent 'big' drop in value the currencies had in late 2017.
Despite the drop in value, it's predicted that cryptocurrency will, in due time, become more normalised and controlled.
Until such times come, many questions come to mind.
The biggest question of them all is are cryptocurrencies the currency of the future?
