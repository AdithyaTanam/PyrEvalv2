For the first time since its launch in 2009, the price of bit coin went up around $15000 to $20000.
Even  though the price has  stabilized at an average of $6500.
So far, the most convincing argument infavour  of cryptocurrencies  is  its underlying technology.
Blockchain is an open and distributed database.
The majority of crptocurrency  skeptics struggle  with the idea that virtual currency is not worth anything at all.
On the other hand, crptocurrencies serve no  practical purposes in the comtempory marketplace and have nothing underwriting  their  value.
As such, it is theoretically impossible to assign a value to them apart  from the fact  a few users have accepted to use them as currency or token and the usual economics of demand and supply.
Some cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin  , are  exceptionally too slow to  process for everyday commercial purposes.
Scams are also common in the crypto universe.
The so-called crypto expert can take advantage of the of regulation to purchase a lot of cheap tokens and then hype them in the mainstream media.
Such recommendations can cause a demand spike that enables the expert to profit from such invesments while others lose their money in the process says CoVEX.
Impartial obsevers are to conlude that cryptocurrencies have no place in modern market place.
