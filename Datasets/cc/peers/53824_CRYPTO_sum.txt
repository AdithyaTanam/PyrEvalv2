In the article ‘Has Crypto-currency peaked?’ there is an overall message that the proponents and opposition for the use of crypto-currency have polarizing opinions on its development.
Evidence clearly shows that by the 14th September (2018), Bitcoin had reached an 80% fall in price from its previous peak in 2017 which in many ways displays the fall in cryptocurrencies prevalence in the market.
More evidence can be inferred that cryptocurrency doesn’t have a large market backing or customer base.
Despite being a strong proponent for Crypto-currencies, Christopher Shake made a change in direction from his original plan of selling his art pieces exclusively for Cryptocurrency and made it possible to buy his art pieces for regular cash.
This could imply that Shake didn’t hold enough confidence in his original plan of selling pieces of art exclusively for Cryptocurrency.
Ths would raise the question of whether Shake is genuinely such a strong proponent for the usage of Cryptocurrency.
It is of vital importance that we in the UK are aware of these kinds of currencies as we will soon be separating from the EU.
Our own British Pound’s value will plummet while cryptocurrencies on the whole will not be affected, this raises a greater question of whether Crypto-currency could be used to fill the void in which our own currency loses its value, but only if Crypto-currency is able to retain or rise in its value.
