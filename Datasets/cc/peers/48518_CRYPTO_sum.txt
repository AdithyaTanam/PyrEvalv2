Rory Cellan-Jones (Technology Consultant, BBC Technology) asks both David Gerrard (Author) and Christopher Shake (Art Gallery Director) whether the “Bitcoin boom” or “bubble” in 2017 and its subsequent negative effects on all Crypto-currencies share prices and general acceptance by merchants has spelled the end for digital money.
The questions have arisen because another Crypto-currency has fallen majorly in share price recently, Cellan-Jones states “The value of Ethereum, Bitcoin's main rival and "the future of crypto" not so long ago, has lurched ever lower and is now 80% below its peak”.
The main idea behind the interview is trying to understand whether Cryptos could be used in the future as a world currency as intended by its inventors to de-centralise banking and financial institutions and spread wealth more evenly across the world or whether their well documented instability and regulatory issues means it will become heavily regulated or shut down entirely.
Shake is enthusiastic about the future of Cryptos and he believes that by his gallery running an exhibition that accepts digital currency it will entice other merchants to start accepting them too.
This will enhance Crypto’s share stability and value.
Gerrard’s view opposes this as he says, “things are moving in the opposite direction - fewer merchants are accepting crypto-currencies because they are so volatile and the promise of smooth cost-free transactions has proved illusory”.
