In September 2018, Rory Cellan-Jones, a technology correspondent for BBC, has published some thoughts on cryptocurrency reliance, where he confronts the opposite ideas of David Gerard and Christopher Shake.
The director of the House of Fine art, Mr Shake, was about the idea of giving cryptocurrency as much importance as standard currency in the occasion of an art exhibition, with the aim to attract potential buyers and, therefore, support the artists.
He believes that it was time for us to accept that digital currency “will add confidence to the market” and it came this far not to vanish but to “stick around”, taking over.
On the opposition, the “attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain” author, David Gerard, was very sceptical on cryptocurrency reliance, stating that fewer businesses would be accepting the use of digital currencies due to their “volatile” nature, with investors losing their money due the constants crisis, lack of regulations and slow transactions.
