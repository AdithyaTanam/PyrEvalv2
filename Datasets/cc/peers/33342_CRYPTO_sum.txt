Its been almost two years since the meteoric rise in market capitalization of major crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and relative newcomer Ripple, which of course was then followed by quite a sharp correction at the beginning of this year which have left some wondering whether crypto-currency has now reached its peak, and whether the blockchain still holds the potential to be a currency in the future.
A recent article from Tech Correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones from the BBC Tech Tent asks one of these questions highlighting the value of Ethereumâ€™s overall 80% decline in market capitalization since its peak in January, as evidence of a steadier downward trend at least for the foreseeable future.
Given that crypto-currencies have been around for almost a decade now, US regulators have also been quite slow when trying to regulate the industry with only last November warning celebrities regarding paid endorsements and disclosure, could this be an indicator that might suggest further regulation ahead providing that overall market capitalization continues its trend upwards for the next ten years and more.
