Many celebrities have backed digital currency.
However, David Gerard proves to disagree, crypto-currencies transaction are not actually smooth cost-free transactions, in 2017 bitcoin transactions were slow and often did not go through at all which is why fewer merchants are accepting crypto-currencies.
