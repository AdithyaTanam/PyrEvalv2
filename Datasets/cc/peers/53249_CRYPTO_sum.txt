the Technology Correspondent from BBC News has been debating the future of crypto-currencies in his article ‘’TechTent: Has crypto-currencies paked?’’ with David Gerard the author of ‘’Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain’’ and Christopher Shake the director of The House Of Fine Art which is a London gallery.
The general view of the article is that the future of crypto-currencies is not as good as people has hoped.
It has already had a massive crash which happened in December and Ethereum the main rival of Bitcoin has drop down by 80% below its peak.
This is due to the fact that the merchants are showing a declining interest the crypto-currencies because is slow and very volatile <REF>.
In 2015 the transaction were clogged.
Christopher Shake has opposing opinion, his view is that many massive merchants like Facebook, Amazon and Goldman Sachs are going to be involved in crypto-currencies something that David Gerard believes to be untrue but he has accepted the fact that crypto-currencies like Bitcoin will not disappear so fast.
His forecast is that crypto-currency will slowly become more regulated and normalised - a rather different vision from that of the early Bitcoin advocates, who saw it smashing the system and making central banks and governments irrelevant <REF>.
The general idea from the article is that the crypto-currencies are not gone to disappear in the near future.
