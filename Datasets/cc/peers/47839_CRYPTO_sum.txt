According to Cellan-Jones (2018) from the BBC, Cryptocurrencies are having difficulties, with company Ethereum, the main rival of Bitcoin, now being valued at 80% lower than its peak.
He continues to say that US regulators are acting against companies involved with cryptocurrencies, and the schemes that they have to create new coins.
Having interviewed various people about the topic, Cellan-Jones has stated that some people believe that cryptocurrencies are growing, with many companies eager to adopt them, and the only reason they are held back is because people cannot spend their bitcoin assets on many products at all.
However, the other side of the argument presented to Cellan-Jones is that Bitcoin is not popular with people anymore, due to its volatility, for example, some transactions donâ€™t go through.
However, both sides of the argument agree that cryptocurrencies are not going to disappear, but disagree about how it will change in the future.
People who are pro-cryptocurrencies believe that the virtual currencies will stay the same, unregulated and decentralised.
However, those with a less positive view on the currencies believe that they will become regulated, and as more of a commodity for people who wish to use an alternative to physical money.
