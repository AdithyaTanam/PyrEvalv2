SCU	34	2	because energy stays the same
//	The speed is highest going down the hill
SCU	35	2	so you go down the hill at a higher speed
SCU	35	2	this means that the roller coaster will speed up as you are going down the track
SCU	36	1	because there is a centripetal force
SCU	37	1	the applied force will stay the same through out the lift unless the car mass changes
SCU	38	1	the next part to our rollercoasters is the hill and loop
SCU	39	1	if the loop got larger, the centripetal force would get smaller
SCU	40	1	the experiments showed that kg was the best because its not too small or too big
SCU	41	1	we could make the lift trek out of a smooth durable material
SCU	42	1	the initial drop is safe because the amount of kinetic energy at the bottom isn t too close to the amount of potential energy at the top
SCU	43	1	because Newtons law would come into play
SCU	44	1	the length is about, the distance would go down due to law of conservation of energy
SCU	45	1	the acceleration would ve been deadly
SCU	46	1	potential energy at the hill top hill shape stayed the same joules
SCU	47	1	the stopping distance isn t effected by mass, but height does
SCU	48	1	kinetic energy at the base of the hill stayed the same joules
SCU	49	1	to be exact, in the simulation, the potential energy was joules
SCU	50	3	as the height of the initial drop increases, so does the distance the car goes
SCU	51	3	joules of potential energy to use at the top
SCU	52	1	it will have a high speed
SCU	53	1	the last part of your roller coaster was the long stretch that would bring the car to a stop
SCU	54	1	at the base, there is only kinetic energy due to the potential energy being burned off
SCU	55	1	I chose kg because it is not too heavy
SCU	56	1	since the mass is small, this also affects the total energy
SCU	57	1	the reason is that are potential energy will stay the same at the top until it goes down the drop
SCU	58	1	at the drop point, the customers would scream and yell the most
SCU	59	1	this should be a great design for the amusement park ride
SCU	60	1	having more energy means you can have more to the rollercoaster
SCU	61	1	the next topic the firm chose was the hill
SCU	62	1	in the simulation the car would always go over the hill no matter what the mass kg
