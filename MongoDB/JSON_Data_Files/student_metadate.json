This is my second time writing to you, from the last essay I have gathered data about mass and speed and the drop height and speed. \nFirst, I made an adjustment to my ID height. I changed it from 4.75m to 3m. I changed my ID height because I figured out that the speed range should be 6.7m/s-8.4m/s to make the ride safe. At the top of the ID, the PE is 1467J enough energy to make it to the bottom of the drop. The KE at the bottom of the drop was 1467J. My data to prove that my ID should be 3m because my speed is 7.66 between 8.4m/s and 6.7m/s  to make it fun and safe. In my data, it shows that my hill height should be 2.50m because the car can get over the hill and go on to the rest of the track. The reason why I am building it at this height is that if it was too small it would not make it to the bottom of the track and the reason that I won't build it any higher is that if you build it too high it would not have enough energy to make it over the hill. In my data, it states that when I put it at 4m and my hill at 4m the car does not have enough energy to make it over the hill, and if my hill is too small like 2.00m and let's say that you have a loopy loop after the ID and the hill that is 5m it would be hanging at the top of the loopy loop and it would no be fun or exciting. Thirdly, I am going to put the car mass to 40KG because that is what mass I used for my trail to make my speed 7.66. If the car was too heavy like 60KG and the ID was 2m and the car would stop and slow down before all of the fun parts of the coaster. It is ok to be too light because if you set your ID to the right height like 3m and the hill at 2.50 the car would make it over the hill and to the fun parts of the ride. How the ID height affects  KE and PE is when the height increases the PE will increase and when the car comes down the track the KE increases and the PE decreases. This will be a pattern throughout the whole ride. The law of conventional energy is energy that can not be destroyed or created and energy comes back in different forms. When mass increases the PE increases and when mass increases the KE increases at the same rate. In my data mass does not affect speed. In my first the mass of my car was 40KG and my speed  at the end of the ride was 7.65m/s and in my second trail my mass was 50KG and my total speed was 7.65m/s. This pattern repeats and mass does not affect speed. Overall, I hope you like my suggestions.\nSincerely, \nCaleb White\n ", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "52", "Raw": "39", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 122", "Quality": " 0.3197", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4472", "Comprehensive": "0.3835", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 23(2), 27(2), 32(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 38(1), 42(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

As the car moves down the hill the PE will get lower and the KE will get higher. how you know that you will have enough PE to make it through the whole ride is that you always have to make the ID higher than the hill so it will make it over the hill and through the whole coaster.

It will be this because the speed with this design was 7.66m/s and it is slower than the safety limit and faster than the fun limit. With this height of 3m, the PE at the top of the ID will be 1466j therefore at the end of the ride the KE will be 1466. All the other experiments were too fast and unsafe and experiment 3 had a speed of 6.99m/s which isn't as fast as 7.66m/s.\n\nI think the hill height should be 2.45m because then you can add another hill, and the ride could still go on. This way you can add other hills after this one in the ride. Here is some data to support my claim. In my first trial, my hill height was 2m, and the PE (potential energy) was 1957j, which the car could go over, but it wouldn't be able to govern another hill after that one, so if you wanted to have a hill with the height of 2m I would recommend having it after all the other hills.\n\nThe car mass for my roller coaster design won't matter because no matter what the car mas is it will have the same speed as shown by my trials. In my trials, I changed the car mass from 40kg-60kg and every single trial had a speed at the bottom of the ID of 7.66. The more mass a car has the more PE the car will have at the top of the ID and the more KE the car will have at the end of the ride.\n\nThe height affects the PE and KE. When the height of the ID is high the PE has more j at the top. When the car makes it to the bottom the PE shifts into KE and this is because of the law of conservation of energy. The more mass the car has the more PE the rollercoaster will have at the top and the more KE it will have at the bottom.\n\n  If you go with my design and have an initial drop of 5m, a hill height of 4.75j and a car mass of 60kg your roller coaster will be a longer ride, energy-packed, and most importantly, a more fun ride.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "34", "Raw": "26", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 102", "Quality": " 0.2549", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.2982", "Comprehensive": "0.2765", "Content Unit": "2(5), 10(3), 17(3), 18(3), 27(2), 32(2), 33(2), 38(1), 46(1), 52(1), 53(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 33 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... hills can be added to the ride\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 52 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

If I picked my highest number which is 2296 there is a possibility that it could go too fast that could not be too safe because it could be bad for the track because the weel could be scratching the track from going too fast and that could give people headaches from how fast it could go. if I go too slow and my slowest is 977 and that would go too slow because I would not have enough energy to go around the loop or a hill going up if you did like I the medium which is 4.31 it could go perfectly go threw the track and would be safe because it is going a good speed and say you want to go on a loop right it would always be on a steep hill if you see a ride with a lot of loops or like a bunch of turns you can see most of the time have a steep hill to get enough energy to do all the stuff I just said[ all the big hills and the loops the turns all that stuff should be safe if we work as a team. and the total is the same because you do not add anything because it is the same of the other.  the difference between an initial drop and hill height is that the initial drop is when your car goes down the initial drop and it gets a bunch of energy but if you want the energy you need the mass of the car and mass is the weight of an object because if you only have like 1mass as your weight it would go really fast because it almost has no weight but sense you have people on the ride so it is heavier.  and if you want the height of the hill you need the initial drop which is where you get your energy.  the PE is the height and the drop and KE is at the hill point to the end of the ride and the PE goes before the KE because the pe is at the top and KE is at the bottom. if I have PE we can make it down the initial drop and the end of the ride and we need PE and KE to make it to the end of the ride.  you won't go slower at the hill because if you go down the initial drop and you have a lot of energy you will lose a little speed going up but won't lose any because you will still go down the hill which would be even. and the mass helps with the speed because you need the mass to get speed. the height affects the speed of the car because if your height is really small/initial drop then you would get like no speed but if your initial drop is high then the energy goes faster so you can reach the end of the ride. height affects PE and KE because if you do not get enough height then you would not be able to use PE and KE because  you need the height to go down so you can get the energy and you also need height for the PE and if you do not have enough energy then you could not go up the hill and the hill is KE.  mass effects the PE and KE because you need the mass to go up things like a hill which is KE and you need the energy but you get energy from the mass of the car because if you hade no mass of the car then you would go flying off and if you have a good amount of mass then you most likely would not go flying off the track and you would just stay normal and have a fun time on the ride and if o have a lot of hills then you would need a lot of energy and that is why there is a big drop at the beginning of the ride.

You probably shouldn't go too much higher, or else it may become unsafe. you should also take into consideration the height of the hill. my studies have shown that if the hill height is higher than the initial drop, the car will not make it to the top of the hill. for example, in my first trial, the initial drop was 5 m tall, and the PE at the top of the initial drop was 1959. the hill height was 3.50, and the car made it to the end of the track. but in my last trial, the initial drop was the same, but the hill was also 5m tall. the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was 1958 joules, but the car just rolled back and did not make it over the hill. the law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can take different forms. therefore, there is no way for the car to make it over the hill without using mechanics. so I think the hill should be lower than the initial drop. in this instance, PE is converted into KE slower than the car is going. that's part of the relationship between PE and KE. you will also need to think about the mass of the car. my studies have shown that if the mass is higher, the potential energy is converted faster into kinetic energy (the energy an object has while in motion), because in my first trial the mass of the car was 40 kg, and the PE at the top of the initial drop was 1955. at the bottom of the initial drop, the kinetic energy was 1950. in another one of my trials, the mass of the car was 58kg, and the PE at the top of the initial drop was 1419 joules. but the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop was only 1392 joules, indicating that the heavier car converted more energy than the lighter car. so the car should be as light as possible for maximum speed.

And for those trials we got some good things for the first one we got MOTC(Mass of the car) was 40 Then SABOF(Speed at Bottom of Drop) was 7.66(m/s)  Then SATOH(Speed at top of the hill)was 3.81 and SATEFTD(the speed at the end of the drop) was 7.66. How the PE affects KE is that if one of them decreases the other one decreases. The important thing that is PE and KE rely on each other. So really KE and PE are like brother and sister because they rely on one another.  The faster the cart goes the more Pe happens than KE. KE and PE are very different PE happens while you are on a flat surface and KE happens when you're on a hill. But if there is no friction  \nthe ride gets more harder to speed up. Friction is made to slow things down. When you are on a hill of rocks there is friction to help you slow down but when you're on the grass there is not as much friction so you'll just keep going faster and faster until you trip and fall and hurt yourself. But the reason why we're helping you make a roller coaster is to make your rides more fun and enjoyable. But the more friction there is the slower the ride goes. So in the beginning, if there is a drop and then goes into a loop there will not be as much friction there is. But it goes into a loop then a drop and at the very end if there is a hill it will hopefully slow the ending the hill will slow the ride so it will go to a complete stop.

First, I would recommend you have an id (initial drop ) height that is at least 3.50m because at that height you are going to have enough energy to make it through the whole ride and you would be under the excitement limit. I don't recommend picking any height lower than 3.50m because then you wouldn't have enough energy for the whole ride. Another reason I recommend the height to be 3.50m is that the higher the height the more potential energy there is, which then turns into kinetic. So the more PE there is the more KE there will be. If you go lower than 3.50m there's a chance that you won't make it through the ride because you ran out of energy. \n\nYou also want the ride to be exciting and fun so I recommend having some loops and or hills. \nIf you do put in hills or loops you need to make them shorter than the id because if there bigger then you would just roll back and forth. I would recommend a height of 2m because then you have a tall hill we`ll still be able to make it all the way through the ride. You can choose any car mass because it won't affect the ride but I would just go with 50kg.\n\nThe id isn't the same as the hill height because the hill height is the PE & KE after the id. To have a better ride you should also make it look nice and appealing and it should also be safe.

There is potential energy (PE) which is the amount of energy an object could have if you dropped it. Then there is kinetic energy (KE), the amount of energy an object has currently. The formula for KE is 1/2 of mass x velocity^2. Also, there is total energy which is the PE + the KE, and represents the total amount of energy an object has on it. Another vocabulary word is The Law of Conservation of Energy which states that energy can't be created or destroyed it just transfers into different forms. There also is the mass(M). Mass is the weight of an object.\n             For an exciting coaster, you want a big hill, which means you need a large drop. A large initial drop increases the PE. The more PE at the top of a drop, the more KE the coaster will have on the down. Also, the Mass greatly affects the PE of the coaster at the top and the KE at the bottom of the initial drop. The heavier the car is the greater the PE and KE. When the mass of the car is 40 then the PE at the top of the drop is 1955 and the KE at the bottom is also 1955. When the mass is 50 then the PE at the top is 2444 and the KE at the bottom is also 2444. When the mass is 60 the PE at the top of the drop is 2932 and the KE at the bottom is also 2932. Another thing is that the hill has to be slightly less than the drop so that the car makes it over without being boring. For example, in my tests, on the coaster with the 4-meter drop and 3.5-meter hill the car had enough energy to make it over, but on the 4-meter drop with the 5-meter hill, the car didn't have enough energy to make it over. The more potential energy at the beginning of the ride, the more KE in the middle of the ride. All the energy is converted into a different type of energy. For an exciting, but safe coaster you want to have a drop of 3.6m and a hill height of 3.49m for a top speed of 8.39 m/s right at the bottom of the drop and at the bottom of the hill. The hill height being close to the drop height will make it even more exciting because there will be that moment of suspense at the top of the hill. Because all the energy is conserved and transferred into a different type of energy, the coaster will always make it over the hill. In my tests, only a drop with more height than the hill could make it over. The speed of the coaster is far over the excitement requirement and under the safety requirement. If the initial drop was lower it would lower the speed and that would decrease the excitement level. In my tests for a 3.11m drop, the speed at the bottom was 7.79 m/s. For a 2.11m drop, the speed at the bottom was 6.4 m/s. For a 3.98m drop, the speed at the bottom was 8.81 m/s. I chose the car mass that I did because in my tests all the masses didn't change anything despite energy. For a car with 40 kg mass, the speed at bottom of the actual size drop I used was 8.40 m/s and at the top of the hill, it was 1.39 m/s. For a car with 50 kg mass, the speed at bottom of the actual size drop I used was 8.40 m/s and at the top of the hill, it was 1.39 m/s. For a car with 60 kg mass, the speed at bottom of the actual size drop I used was 8.40 m/s and at the top of the hill, it was 1.39 m/s. So I just chose the middle one because they all had the same speed. The Mass greatly affects the PE at the top and KE at the bottom. In my trials for the 40 kg Mass car had 1955 J of PE at the top and 1955 J KE at the bottom. For the 50 kg Mass car had 2444 J of PE at the top and 2555 J KE at the bottom. For the 60 kg Mass car had 2932 J of PE at the top and 2932 J KE at the bottom.\n\n                                                                Sincerely, Isaac the engineer", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "71", "Raw": "54", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.4060", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6193", "Comprehensive": "0.5126", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 4(4), 6(4), 12(3), 14(3), 17(3), 18(3), 20(2), 27(2), 32(2), 35(2), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 47(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 20 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... which is the amount of energy\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 2": "Content Unit: 51 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

I think this because As my height for trials 1-2 increased from 40 m to 45 m the pe also increased from 1955 to 2219 and the same thing for my other 2 trials. when the height of my id increased so did the pe at the top and the ke at the bottom. Also, when I increased the car mass the ke pe and te all went up I know because my data states that the car with a mass of 45 had a much greater total energy of 2219 than the car with a mass of 40 and total energy of 1995.  so If we know that if we follow the law of conservation of energy the car with a total energy of 2219 will perform better in general. That brings us to our next statement that friction will be there and if the car is too heavy, it will not make it to the end of the ride, so we must find a good balance to get the car to the end of the ride. next order of business the height of the hill must be lower than the height of the id or the car will never finish the ride. As the car moves down the hill It is gaining ke and losing pe and pe is what keeps the car going and we will need a good id to get the car down the track. height is related to energy exp: when I moved the car up the track or razed the hill height the pe ke and te all increase. lastly are id must be taller than the hill and my data showed that when the id is higher than the hill the cat made it but when the hill was lower the car doubled back.\nThe car must be high enough to make the car finish at the minimum speed and below the max speed.  the car id will be 3.50 because that is the cut-off for speed safety.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "6278bd4430da3ae9a16a451f", "class_id": "1", "teacher_id": "GS", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "Dear Gonzales family, \nI have some important ideas about your roller coaster. I will be sharing what I believe your ID height should be, your hill height, and car mass for the new roller coaster. First, I believe that your ID height for the roller coaster should be 3m. The reason I claim it should be 3m is that when the coaster was at 4m it was too fast and didn't make the speed limit. The speed limit has to be between 6.7 m/s to 8.4 m/s. The speed was 8.83 m/s. KE was 0j at the top and PE was 1954j at the top, but at the bottom, KE had 1954j when PE had 0j. The Law of Conservation of Energy would be 1954j because it's the total amount of energy. The ID height also can't be 2m if the hill height is also 2 meters because the coaster doesn't make it up the hill. There will still be PE but KE will be at 0 since it doesn't make it up the hill. Another reason the ID height should be 3m is that the speed is at 7.65 which is perfectly In the middle of the speed limit. PE is at 1468j at the top and KE is at 0j but at the bottom, KE is at 1468j and PE is at 0j. Law of Conservation of energy is also 1468j. Also, the height affects the amount of energy in the coaster. That is why 3m should be the height of the ID. \nSecondly, I consider the hill height of this design to be 2.25m. I believe the hill should be at 2.25m because if are ID height is 3m, the hill has to be shorter so the car can make it over the hill. One reason I can support that claim is that when the height was 3.50, PE at the top was 1470j and KE at the top was 0j however, close to the top of the hill PE was 1231j and KE was 239j  but it didn't make it over the hill since there was more height at the hill than the ID. Another reason I choose 2.25m to be the hill height is that if we have a hill at 2m it won't be as fun of a coaster and as fast as 2.25. However, at the top PE is at 1468j and KE is at 0j but at the bottom, KE is at 1468j and PE is at 0j. The Law of conservation of Energy is also 1468j. The speed does fit within our limit but the hill is shorter and won't be very exciting for some of your customers. That is why 2.25 should be the hill height of the new roller coaster. \nFinally to finish off our design the car mass should be 50kg. Car mass doesn't affect speed it affects the total amount of energy. I want the car to be at 50kg because it's perfect in the middle and goes smoothly across the track. Another reason 50kg should be the car mass is that when it was 60kg the total amount of energy was 1762j, at the top  PE would be 1762j and KE would be 0j, but at the bottom, KE is 1762j and PE is 0j. One other reason car mass should be 50kg is because when it was 40kg the total amount of energy was 1175j. PE was 1175j at the top and KE was 0j. At the bottom PE was 0j and KE was 1175j.  The car mass needs energy to have a successful coaster. This is why is choose 50kg because it's in the middle of the 40kg and 60kg. \nIn conclusion, my statement is that the ID height should be 3m, the hill height should be 2.25, and finally, the car mass should be 50kg. I have given reasoning and evidence about why I am correct and those should be the options. I hope you agree with my ideas and look forward to using them.\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "59", "Raw": "41", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 129", "Quality": " 0.3178", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4702", "Comprehensive": "0.3940", "Content Unit": "2(5), 10(3), 13(3), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 27(2), 32(2), 35(2), 44(1), 46(1), 47(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The more energy it uses the more momentum the car will go down with and will help decide if the hill will work, the hill PE and KE must be lower than the initial drop KE, and PE.

For example, If you have an ID that is 3 meters tall and has 1466 j of PE and you put in a hill that is also 3.5 meters and needs 1719 j of KE to get over the hill it won't make it over because the ID was too small. When you have more potential energy, you get more KE at the bottom of a drop and more speed. When the car moves down a drop, it will lose PE but gain KE as it gains speed, that is the law of conservation of energy. We are also going to make the hill height 3.5 meters because if we make the hill taller than the ID it won't make it over the hill. For example, If you have an ID that is 5 meters tall and has 1466 j of PE and you put in a hill that is also 6 meters and needs 1719 j of KE to get over the hill it won't make it over because the height of the hill was larger than than the initial drop. When the car goes up a hill it turns the KE that it has into PE as it loses speed. One reason we need a higher hill height is that it can then go over bigger loops and hills at a faster speed and not stop in the middle of the loop or hill. We also cant make the hill any higher than the last drop or else it won't make it over. Lastly, it is easier for the car to make it to the end if it has more mass. The more mass it has the greater the amount of PE there is and that means it is able to make it to the end of the ride. For example, if the car has a mass of 50 kg it will have 1444 j of PE at the top of the ID but if the mass of the car is 60 kg it will have 2932 j of PE at the top of the ID. That means that the more mass you have, the greater the PE and KE. But the mass of the car does not affect the speed of the car.

This is because the higher the car is, the more potential energy it has. For example, when the initial drop height was 2 meters, the potential energy, or stored energy, was 1173 Joules. However, when the height was 5 meters, the potential energy was 2932 Joules. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, so the total energy always stays the same. The potential energy just converts into kinetic energy, or motion energy. This means that there is 1172 Joules of kinetic energy at the bottom of the 2 meter drop, and 2930 Joules at the bottom of the 5 meter drop. At the bottom of both of these drops, the potential energy is 1 Joule. As the car goes down the drop, the potential energy changes to kinetic energy. This is when there is no friction. With friction, some of the potential energy gets converted into thermal or sound energy. The more kinetic energy there is, the more speed there is, because kinetic energy=1/2*mass*velocity squared, and velocity and speed are pretty much the same thing. When the initial drop height was 5 meters, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.88 m/s, which is too fast, and the speed at the bottom of the 4 meter initial drop was 8.84, which is still too fast. These are all when the car was 60 kilograms.\n\nAfter the initial drop, there will be a hill. The hill should be anywhere below the initial drop is because the car won't have enough kinetic energy to make it over if they are the same height. When the hill is below the initial drop height, there is more kinetic energy, so it can continue to move over the top of the hill. For instance, when the hill height was 2 meters, there was 1764 Joules of kinetic energy at the top of the hill. However, there was only 18 Joules of kinetic energy at the top of the 5 meter hill, which wasn't quite enough to make it over. This is when the initial drop was 5 meters.\n\nLastly, the car should be around 60 kilograms. This is because the more mass the car has, the more potential energy it has at the top, and the more kinetic energy at the bottom. When the car mass was 40 kilograms, it had 1957 Joules of potential energy at the top of the initial drop. However, when the car mass was 60 kilograms, there was 2936 Joules of potential energy at the top of the initial drop. The more potential energy at the top, the more kinetic energy at the bottom. This will help the car make it through the roller coaster easier. However, the mass doesn't affect the speed. When the drop height was 5 meters and the mass was 40 kilograms, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.84 m/s. The speed was also 8.84 m/s when the car was 50 kilograms and 60 kilograms.

The height of my drop affects PE at the top because when the drop is 2 m high there are 1173 joules of PE but when I increase it to 3.5 m there are 2052 jouls of energy so when the height goes up so does PE. This is the same with KE at the bottom, when the drop is 2 m high there are 1172 joules of KE but when I increase it to 3.5 m there are 2051 jouls of KE so when the height goes up so does KE at the bottom of the drop. That just shows how pe at the top and ke at the bottom are related, they flip because they are the inverse of each other.\n\n\nWhen it comes to PE TE and KE being related they could not be any more than that. The TE is just the PE and the KE is being added no matter when in the coaster it is if you add PE and KE you Get TE. As you go down the drop your PE which used to be very high starts to drop then it is being converted into KE this is because when it starts to move from its original drop it's losing its potential to start moving and just is moving. As it's losing its potential to move its energy is being converted to other types of energy like thermal energy and sound energy. This is because of the LAW OF CONSERVATION ON ENERGY this is the law where energy can't be created or destroyed so the car isn't losing energy but is going elsewhere. As your coaster is going it will have to have hills but because we can not use mechanical energy the drop height has to be larger than the hill height this is so the car can make it over the hill.

When our initial drop height was 4m the car traveled at 8.84 m/s which is too fast but when our height was 3.5m the car traveled at 8.27 m/s which is a safe speed. The higher the initial drop the more potential energy the ride has. When our initial drop height was 3m our PE at the top was 1407 J. When our initial drop height was 3.5m our PE at the top was 1642 J. The track should have hills because who wants a ride without them but if we add hills the hills height has to decrease. The hill height can not be higher or equal to the initial drop or the hill before it. When we did a test where the initial drop height was 5m and the hill height was 5m the car failed to make it over the top of the hill and was stuck. When the hill height was 4m the car was able to successfully get over the hill. The mass of the car is also an important thing to think about because it directly impacts both KE and PE. Mass has a direct relationship with KE and PE meaning when one increases the other increases and vice versa. When our car mass was 40kg the PE at the top of the initial drop was 1955 J and the KE at the bottom of the drop was 1955 J. When we increased the mass to 50kg the car's PE at the top of the initial drop increased to 2444 J and the car's KE at the bottom increased to 2443 J. When the mass increased the energy that the car had also increased. The total energy throughout the ride will remain the same the entire time. The law of the conservation of energy says that energy can not be created nor destroyed. The PE that we have at the start of the ride changes into KE as the car moves down. When our initial drop was 4m the PE at the top of the initial drop was 1876 J but at the end of the ride the KE was 1874 J and the PE was 1 J showing that the energy was all still there just as a different type of energy. All of the PE has converted to KE. All of the energy from the beginning is still there. When the car goes up on the hills some of the KE turns back into PE since the car is gaining height but not all of it like it had at the start before it began moving. In our trial where the initial drop was 5m and the hill height was 3m the PE at the top of the initial drop was 2348 J but when the car was at the top of the hill the PE was only 1417 J and the other 931 J of energy were KE. Our PE at the top of the initial drop is the same as the KE at the end of the ride because the energy is not able to leave and instead is only able to convert into different types of energy. From our initial drop data with the trial where our initial drop was 2m the PE at the top of the hill was 938 J and at the bottom of the ride the KE was 938 J showing us that all of the energy we had at the start is still present but it has converted from PE to KE as the car went down the drop. They have an inverse relationship which means that when one increases the other decreases or when one decreases the other increases. As the PE decreased while it was going down the initial drop the KE was increasing. The mass of the car does not matter since mass does not affect speed. When our mass was 40kg our speed was 8.27 m/s and when our mass was 60kg our speed was still 8.27 m/s. I say that the mass of the car should be 48kg just because its a fun random number and we dont have to worry about it changing our speed. \n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "55", "Raw": "47", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 125", "Quality": " 0.3760", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5390", "Comprehensive": "0.4575", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 10(3), 17(3), 18(3), 27(2), 28(2), 33(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 28 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

This clearly shows that the higher your drop height is, the more PE the car will have at the top but when the height was 4m then the speed at the bottom was 8.84m/s so that is too fast and the ride won't be safe. The speed when the initial drop was 3m was 7.66 at the fastest, so that is between the 8.4m/s and the 6.7m/s that we need.\n\nAs it goes down the PE will convert into KE, showing that they have an inverse relationship or when the PE goes down, then the KE will go up and by the time it gets to the bottom, almost all of the total energy will be KE. \n\nThe TE never changes because the Law of Conservation of Energy says that energy can be transferred from one kind to another. In this case, it is going from PE to KE or as it goes up the hill from KE to PE. But the energy cannot be created or destroyed, so with a higher height, there will be a lot more KE at the bottom and the car will go farther and faster. \n\nWe want the hill height to be 4.5m we can't have the hill at 5m because in our testing we found that the only way the roller coaster car will get to the end is if the height of the hill is smaller than the height of our drop. This is proven when we had a hill height of 3.5m and a drop height of 5m then the car did get to the end, but when the hill height was 5m and the drop height was 5m, then the car didn't get to the end so the hill has to be smaller than the initial drop. \n\nMass and potential energy have a direct relationship, or when the mass goes up, so does the potential energy. This is proven when the mass was 40kg, then the PE at the top was 1959J, but when the mass was 60kg, then the PE at the top was 2938J, so when the mass goes up the PE at the top also goes up, or a direct relationship. Mass and kinetic energy also have a direct relationship, or when the mass goes up, the KE also goes up. This is proven when the car mass was 40kg, the KE at the bottom was only 1959J, but when the car mass was increased to 60kg, then the KE at the bottom also increased to 2938J, so when the KE goes up, the PE goes up, or a direct relationship. This is why we want our car mass to be 60kg so that the car will reach the end easier. This shows that whenever the mass is increased, the PE and KE also increase.\n\nMass and speed are not related as long as there is no friction. When the mass was 40kg, the max speed was 8.84m/s and when we increased the mass to 60kg, the mass was still 8.84m/s. This is because the PE at the top of the drop is equal to the KE at the bottom of the drop. So when I put the 2 equations for PE and KE equal to each other since mass is on both sides of the equation, then they cancel each other out, meaning mass does not affect the speed at all. Also assuming there is no friction, then the PE at the top of the drop will be the same as the KE at the bottom of the drop.\n\nHeight and speed have a direct relationship, or when the height goes up, so does the speed at the bottom of the hill. This is proven when the drop height was 3m the speed at the bottom was 7.66m/s, and when the height increased to 5m the speed at the bottom also increased to 9.88m/s.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "53", "Raw": "53", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 123", "Quality": " 0.4309", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6078", "Comprehensive": "0.5193", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 14(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 27(2), 29(2), 31(2), 35(2), 38(1), 42(1), 46(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 52 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... so that is too fast and the ride\n\t", "sentence 9 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 2 [Weight: 5]\n\tSegment: ....................

With more height on the drop, there is more potential energy at the top of the initial drop. Then as the cart starts to go down the drop, the potential energy decreases and kinetic energy increases, so starts to transform into kinetic energy until there is very little potential energy and a lot of kinetic energy (meaning there is more PE at the top and less KE at the top. And more KE at the bottom and less PE). Like when the initial drop was 5 meters so there was 2541 Joules of potential energy and 0J of kinetic energy. Then by the time it got to the bottom of the hill, the potential energy was 1 Joule and the kinetic energy increased to 2540J. \n\nThere is a pattern here. Total energy always stays the same. PE at the top and KE at the bottom are related because there is the same amount of PE at top and KE at the bottom. Lets say PE is 1378J at the top of the hill, then the KE at the bottom would be 1378J or 1377J because we know that there is more PE at top and more KE at bottom, and energy stays the same.There was a total energy of 2541J at the beginning of the coaster and at the end, there was also 2541J of energy. This pattern is known as the Law of Conservation of Energy, stating where the amount of energy is not created or destroyed. \n\nIf the Gonzales family coasters initial drop is 5 meters, the next hill should be smaller than the initial drop, which is 5 meters because if it isn't, the cart won't get enough speed or energy to make it up the hill for the next drop. Like how when the initial drop was 5 meters and the hill height was 4 meters, the cart made it up the hill no problem. However, if the initial drop was 4 meters and the hill was 5 meters, the cart wouldn't make it up the hill.The hill height should be 4 meters for that reason. \n\nAnother thing to take into consideration is how much mass the cart should be. A cart with more mass would be good because the more mass the cart has, the kinetic and potential energy it has. Like how when the cart mass was 60kg and had a total energy of 2934J. But when the cart had 40kg (less mass) it only had a total energy of 1956J. Which is why the cart mass should be 60kg.\n\nFor the height should be 4 meters so the cart doesn't get too much speed like how when the drop height was 4 meters, the energy was 8.83J (which was lower than the amount of energy when the speed was less . And the mass should be 50kg because that is a lot of kg and the more mass, the more energy there is. More height and mass gives us more energy. Like how when the mass was 50kg, the speed was 8.84J (which is more energy then when the mass was less). \n\nHeight and mass effect speed in opposite ways. The more height there is, the more speed the cart gets. Like how hen the height was 4 meters, the speed was 8.83m/s/s. And when the height was 5 meters, the speed was 9.3m/s/s. But not matter the amount of mass there is, the speed does not change. Like when the mass was 50 and 40kg, the speed stayed the same at 8.83m/s/s. \n\nThe Law of Conservation of Energy affects my design because with all the rules I talked about above, the mass and height need to be taken into consideration to get the right speed and energy to make it to the end of the ride.

Since PE and KE have a direct relationship when one increases the other will also increase, this will also increase the TE in the end.\n\n    At the beginning of the roller coaster, all the energy is going to the PE and the KE is at zero but at the end of the roller coaster the PE is at one (because it is still off the ground) and the KE has increased. This is because of the conservation of energy which says we can't destroy energy, it can only change into a different type of energy in this case it is KE, that the PE is converting into. \n\n    At the top of the initial drop, there is only so much energy that can be converted into KE to help It get to the end of the roller coaster so if the initial drop is at a certain number then the hill height can't be the same height or higher. When I tested this and put the hill height at five meters and the initial drop at five meters the car did not make it over the hill. But let's look more closely at the top of the initial drop there was 2939J of PE. at the top of the hill there was 2934J of PE and only 4J of KE which means it did not have enough velocity to make it over the hill. But does the mass of the car affect if the car will make it over the hill? The answer is yes, when you have more mass you have more PE and that energy can be converted into KE making it go faster. We saw this when I tested how mass affects energy when I put the mass at 40kg the PE was at 1957J of PE but when I increased the mass to 60kg the PE went up to 2936J of PE this means that when the mass is larger the more energy the car has. This is why when the car is heavier it will go faster. \n\n    Another question that people might have is does the mass affect the speed of the roller coaster? The answer is no. This is a big miss conception that people have about mass and speed. When I tested this I put the mass at 40kg the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.84 m/s, when I increased the mass to 60kg the speed at the bottom of the coaster was still the same. This is because the mass does not change throughout the roller coaster when other parts like the PE and the KE are changing. The speed does not rely on the mass but it relies on the height and gravity to determine how fast the car will go. \n\n    That was PE, KE, mass, height, and gravity affect how a rollercoaster works.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "36", "Raw": "34", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 106", "Quality": " 0.3208", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3899", "Comprehensive": "0.3553", "Content Unit": "2(5), 12(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 23(2), 27(2), 32(2), 35(2), 36(1), 42(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 23 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... and gravity affect how a roller coaster works and moves.\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 36 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... because that is the way\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... and throughout the roller coaster the PE will convert into KE\n\t         .................... giving it more energy overall.\n\t", "sentence 6 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 2 [Weight: 5]\n\tSegment: ....................

It should be as high as possible because the higher something is, the more potential energy there is at the start and kinetic energy at the end. When I tested the simulation, the PE of the coaster was 2932 at 5 meters. At 4 meters, the PE was just 1173. This shows you should make the drop as high as possible because the higher you make the initial drop, the more energy you will have in total. Another important thing to consider is the mass of the car. I also believe that the mass should be as high as possible, at a mass of 60 kg. I believe this because when we tested it out, the 60 kg car had a PE at the top and KE at the bottom of 2938. But, when I tested out a mass of 50 kg, the PE at the top and KE at the bottom were just 2449. This shows that the more mass something has, the more energy it has. Therefore, the mass should be 60 kg because you want the most energy possible. The reason the PE matters at the beginning is because PE converts to KE which is how much energy the coaster has while it is moving. This is the law of conservation of energy which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed so you want a high PE so that you have a high KE since the total energy stays the same. While the coaster is going down the drop, the PE will start converting into KE. So, around the middle of the drop, the KE and PE will be about the same, but, as it keeps going, the KE will get higher and higher. Once the coaster gets to the bottom of the drop, the PE will be at 0 and the KE will be at whatever the total energy is. But, now the coaster gets to the hill and starts going up again. As this happens, the KE starts converting back into PE until it gets to the top again and the cycle repeats. The hill height also matters because the higher the hill is, the more energy you will have, just like the initial drop. But, when you make the hill, you have to remember that it must be shorter than the height of the initial drop, or it won't make it to the end. The PE and the KE are related because the PE basically is just how much energy there could possibly be. Because there is no friction, all of the PE converts into KE so it is all the same energy which proves the law of conservation of energy. You want a higher initial drop because the higher something is, the more PE it will have meaning the more speed there will be. I know this because the equation for potential energy is PE=mgh and because PE and height are on different sides of the equal side, you know that a bigger height makes a bigger PE/speed. This is not the case for mass though because mass cancels out on both the KE and PE equations meaning all that is left is gh=v^2. Because the gravity and height don't change during the tests, neither does the speed showing that mass doesn't affect speed. That isn't totally the case in the real world though because friction will still put more force on the lighter objects causing them to go slower. The PE at the top is related to the KE at the bottom because the PE converts into the KE meaning it will be the same number of joules in a frictionless world since it", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "43", "Raw": "46", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 113", "Quality": " 0.4071", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5275", "Comprehensive": "0.4673", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 11(3), 15(3), 22(2), 25(2), 27(2), 31(2), 33(2), 34(2), 36(1), 37(1), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 47(1), 49(1), 50(1), 52(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

This is because when we ran the test, at 4 meters the drop had 1876 joules of PE at the top and 1875 joules of KE at the bottom, but at 5 meters it had 2346 joules of PE at the top and 2346 joules of KE at the bottom. So the higher the drop the greater the amount of energy. \nAs the car is going down the drop the PE is changed into KE because they have an inverse relationship, but the total energy, which is KE plus PE, stays the same because of the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy can't be created or destroyed. When the car is going down the drop the PE is going down while the KE is going up. When the car goes up the hill the KE goes down while the PE goes up. \nThe car's mass has an effect on all of this too. The higher the mass of the car the greater the PE at the top of the drop and the greater the KE at the bottom of the drop. In our experiment, when the car's mass was 40 Kg the PE was 1955 joules at the top and the KE was 1955 joules at the bottom. When the car's mass was 50 Kg the PE was 2431 joules at the top and the KE was 2431 joules at the bottom. \nWe suggest having a hill of 3 meters because the higher the hill the more energy it takes to get up it. In our experiment when the hill was 3 meters tall the car was able to get over it and continue on, but when the hill was 5 meters tall the car didn't have enough energy to make it over. Using this shows the hill should be shorter than the initial drop.\nThen we tested the impact these things have on speed. In our test, we had the height of the initial drop at 5 meters and it had a speed of 9.89 meters per second at the bottom of the initial drop. When we tested it at an initial drop height of 4 it had a speed of 8.84 meters per second. This shows that speed and height have a dependent relationship. After this, we decided to change the height of the initial drop to 3.5 meters to make it safe. \nNext, we tested the effect that mass has on speed. we tested a mass of 40 Kg and at the bottom of the initial drop it had a speed of 8.27 meters per second. we then tested a mass of 50 Kg and at the bottom of the initial drop it had a speed of 8.27 meters per second. this shows that mass does not affect speed, so we decided to keep the mass at 48 Kg.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "40", "Raw": "46", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 110", "Quality": " 0.4182", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5275", "Comprehensive": "0.4729", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 10(3), 11(3), 15(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 29(2), 32(2), 35(2), 37(1), 39(1), 42(1), 46(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 46 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... but at meters it had joules of PE at the top and joules of KE at\n\t         .................... the bottom.\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

PE and KE will always equal the total energy because the law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed so when the KE goes down the PE goes up. so in the first trial when we had PE at 1173J and KE at 0J the total energy was 1173J and at the bottom when KE was 1172J the PE was 1J equaling 1173J in all. the total energy will never change and the energy from PE just converts to KE and vise versa. In the first trial I did the PE was at 1173J and the KE was at 0J. at the bottom the KE was at 1172J and the PE was at 1J. the PE was converted to KE as the car went down the drop. in the second trial the PE was 1759J and the KE was 0J. at the bottom the PE was 1J and the KE was 1758J. \n\nthe law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created nor destroyed meaning that all the energy goes somewhere even if it is not useable energy. when the car goes down the drop the PE converts to KE. if the KE and the PE don't add up to the total energy then that shows us that the energy converted to other types like sound and thermal energy. \n\nwhen thinking about a hill height the intal drop height has to be higher than the hill height or the car will not have enough KE to get over the hill. in my hill data that I collected my first trail had a drop height of 5 meters and a hill height of 2 meters. the PE at the top of the drop was 2932J and the KE at the top of the hill was 1149J. the higher the hill got the less KE there was. in trial number 4 the hill height was 5 meters and the PE at the top of the drop was 2939J and the KE at the top of the hill was 1J which is not enough to get over the hill and the car did not make it. \n\nthe more mass the car has the more PE and KE it has also. when mass goes up the PE and KE will go up too. in my last set of trials my first trial I had the car at 40 kg and the PE at the top of the drop was 1957J the KE at the bottom was 1953J. in my third trail the mass of the car was 60 kg and the PE at the top increased to 2936J and the Ke at the bottom increased to 2907J. \n\nfor the height of the initial drop you want it to be 3.5. I found that this is the best height because in my first trial I had a height 3 meters and the end speed was 7.65 m/s and that is good but not as fast as I would like. when I used a height of 4 meters the speed at the end of the ride was 8.83 and the max speed for safety is 8.4 so anything 4 or above is not going to work. I thought that why not go in the middle and have a height of 3.5 meters. the end speed for 3.5 was 8.26 and that is still fast but not above the max speed. \n\nthe height for the initial drop should be 3.5 meters and the hill height should be 2 meters. the hill height should not be higher than or equal to the drop height because then the car will not make it over the hill. the mass does not matter as it does not change anything dealing with speed. in all my trials I had a mass of 40, 50, or 60 kg and the speed was always 8.84 m/s. \n\nthe more height there is the more PE, KE and speed there is too. in my first trial for height and speed I had a drop height of 3 meters and the speed was 7.65 m/s. when I increased the drop height to 4 meters the speed was 8.83 m/s at the end of the ride. we already know that the more height the more PE and KE from our other trials along with mass.

If the hill height is at the highest point, 5 meters, in this case, the car will go a lot further. When the friction is zero the energy will not convert into other energy because there is no friction. So the potential energy at the top of the highest drop is 2,932 Joules and the kinetic energy at the bottom is 2,930 Joules. It is a little lower because there is still a small amount of potential energy because there is no friction. The total energy stays the same, so if it looks like it was created or destroyed it did not, it just changed into other forms of energy like heat or sound energy. That's why when you rub your hands together they get warm after a minute or when you clap it makes a sound. \n\nWhen the car goes down the drop the potential energy goes down because there is less and less of a hill in front of it and the kinetic energy goes up because it is gaining speed. The drop height and the hill height also affect the coaster and how far it goes. If the initial drop is 5 m and the hill height is 4.5, most of the potential energy will get transferred into kinetic energy as the car gains speed. That is what the law of conservation of energy says, that energy cannot be created or destroyed. That's why it changes into different energy.\n\n Then when it starts going up the hill the kinetic energy starts going down and the potential energy starts going up because it is increasing altitude. For example, when the car went down the initial drop the potential energy was 2,931 and at the top of the hill, it was 1,465. That extra energy changes into kinetic energy and we know that because there is no friction. When the car gets higher up the more potential energy it has because there is more room for it to go down the drop. \n\nAnother thing is the mass. Most of the time on a sledding hill and one person is on it you would think that it is going to go slower, or faster if there are more people on it. but mass does not affect the speed, height does. when we changed the mass to 40 kg, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.85. but then when the mass was 60 kg, the speed at the bottom was still 8.85. this shows that the mass does not affect the speed. the mass probably affects more of the distance it travels, making it seem like there is more speed when really it just makes it go farther.\n\nSo if the mass does not affect the speed, why do heavier objects hit the ground first? It is because of air resistance. Lighter objects just have more resistance in the air as well as surface area. if you drop a piece of paper and a marker, not only is the marker smaller, but the paper has more surface area for air to get trapped under it to hold it up. since when you change the height it changes the energy, it also changes the speed. when you make the initial drop higher it makes the potential energy higher and so then when it goes down the hill it changes into kinetic energy and the kinetic energy is the speed or velocity. if you change the height, it makes the speed higher.\n\nThe initial drop height needs to be higher than the hill height because otherwise, it will not make it over the hill. If the initial drop potential energy is 100 Joues then that will change into kinetic energy and so if the hill is higher than the drop there will not be enough energy to go over the hill. Since the potential energy affects the speed the mass does not affect the potential or kinetic energy at all. if it did, then when the potential energy went up the kinetic would to affecting in the speed being higher and we found out in the experiment that the mass does not change the speed. this is how you would make a good rollercoaster that has the right amount of energy and mass, hill height and drop height, and what to add to make it a fun and working rollercoaster.

For example, when the drop height was 2.5 the potential energy at the start was 1270 and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1270 Jules. And when the drop was 4.5 the potential energy at the start was 2033 and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2032.  \nThe relationship between potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy is that potential energy + kinetic energy at the bottom is equal to the total energy which is the same as the potential energy at the start because no energy can be lost or gained. \n\n\nThe change in potential energy and kinetic energy going down the hill is that at the top of the hill there is still more potential energy than kinetic energy but as it goes down the hill the potential energy turns into kinetic energy so there is now more kinetic energy than the potential energy going down the hill. \nThe law of conservation is that no energy can be lost or gained so because no energy can be lost or gained the energy transfers from potential energy to kinetic energy or kinetic energy to potential instead of disappearing it turns into a different type of energy. \n\nIf the drop height is lower than the hill then the car will not make it up the hill without being pulled up.

The law of conservation of energy affects the design because it shows how the height and mass can change the amount of energy.

The law of conservation of energy says that energy may not be created or destroyed so when the car rolls down the hill the potential energy will be turned into kinetic energy and with friction, it may turn into thermal and sound energy as well, the total energy will stay the same throughout because it cannot be destroyed or created. In order for the car to make it to the end of the ride, the hill height must be shorter than the initial drop height. For example, if the drop height is 4 meters and the hill height is 5 meters the car will roll back down because it does not have enough energy to make it over the hill. \n\nThe more mass the car has the greater potential and kinetic energy it will have for example if the car mass is 50 kg the potential energy will be 2441 joules and the kinetic energy will be 2436 joules, but if the car mass is 60 kg the potential energy will be 2938 joules and the kinetic energy will be 2888 joules this shows that mass and potential and kinetic energy have a direct relationship.\n\nThe relationship between potential, kinetic, and total energy is total and potential at the initial drop will always stay the same but kinetic energy, at the initial drop will be at 0 joules since it still hasn't moved or changed into kinetic yet, but when the potential energy changes to kinetic energy the total energy and potential energy stay the same. The height affects potential energy and kinetic energy in a direct relationship. This means if the drop height is high the potential and kinetic energy will be higher as well. For example, when I had an initial drop height of 2 meters the potential energy at the top of the hill was 977 joules and at the end of the hill the kinetic energy was 977 joules also, but when I had an initial deop height of 5 meters the potential energy at the top of the hill was 2443 joules and at the end of the hill the kinetic energy was 2443 joules.\n\nThe speed of your car relates to the height and how much energy the car has, not the mass.

So as you're going down the hill, all of that potential energy will transfer into kinetic energy by the bottom of the drop.

A starting hill height of 4 meters had a speed of 8.81m/s which is too big. 3 meters had a speed of 7.54m/s which is in the range but could be improved, so I split the difference between 4 meters and 3 meters.

This is because when the initial drop is at its highest, it also has the most PE at the top of the hill and the most KE at the bottom of the hill. The higher off the ground the car is, the more PE it's gonna have. The more speed the car has, the more KE it's gonna have. Potential energy is super important because it's what you are going to have the most of at the start of the ride. This potential energy is constantly converting into different forms of energy like Kinetic energy and back, which is how the car will get its motion and be able to make it to the end. Since the energy is converting, it is neither being created nor destroyed also known as the law of conservation of energy which is how we know the total energy (between PE, KE, heat energy, sound energy, etc.) is always going to stay the same. \n\nThe coaster will start at the top of the drop with potential energy. As we have already said, PE relies on height and if it is not moving at the top, there will be no KE. From our data, if the initial drop is 5 meters tall, then the PE and TE might be somewhere around 2443 J. as the roller coaster increases speed, it also increases kinetic energy making the PE covert into KE. At the same time, the height of the car is decreasing as well as the PE. as we know the energy isn't being destroyed, it's just turning into different forms of energy. This is called a direct relationship, when one goes down the other goes down, and the other way around. When the car reaches the bottom of the drop, the potential energy will be zero, and the rest of the energy will have converted into other forms but mainly kinetic energy because the car has increased speed. The same thing happens as the ride continues.\n\nWhen we are building the hill, this needs to be shorter than the initial drop in order for the ride to continue. I know this because from my data when I had a hill lower than the initial drop, the car made it to the end and the lower the hill the more KE it had at the top meaning it was going to have more speed. When the hill was the same height or taller, the car did not make it over the hill and to the end. So this tells us that the height of our hill needs to be lower than the initial drop height. \n\nLet's talk about the mass of the car. Let's say the car had 60 kg of mass. When the car was at the top of the drop, it had 2932 J of PE. now as the car increased speed and made it to the bottom it had the same amount of KE. (because there was no friction.) Now let's say the car is 50kg. The PE at the top of the drop is lower, making it 2443 kg. Just like before, the KE and TE remained the same. This shows us that a car with a higher mass is a better choice because it will have more energy and more potential to make it to the end of the ride.\n\nNow that we have done more exploring we have changed up some of the areas of our ride. First of all, the mass of our car does not matter because no matter the mass, the car will always have the same speed in a frictionless environment. When we used a mass of 40kg for the car, the speed at the end of the ride was 8.26m/s. The car has the same speed at the end of the ride when it had a mass of 50 kg and 60kg. \n\nFor the heights of the hills and loops, each needs to be lower than the initial drop height and the previous loop or hill height so that it has enough energy to make it to the end. When the car is starting higher, it has more PE which at it starts accelerating and has no height it will all be transferred into KE. And as it continues to gain height and slow down it will begin to gain PE so if we have enough KE then the car can make it to the end of the ride. The higher the initial drop height we used, the more speed the car had throughout the ride. For example, when it was 5m high, the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88J. When the initial drop height was 4m high, the speed at the end of the ride was 8.83J. If we want it to have higher hills and loops and allow the car to make it to the end, then a higher hill height will be better. This shows us that height and speed have a direct relationship, if one goes up, the other also goes up.\n\nThe law of conservation of energy states that no energy can be created or destroyed. This law affects our design because this means that the energy is going to be the same throughout the ride. We cant simply add energy to allow our car to make it to the end, we have to consider all of the things that affect the conversions and transfers of energy. Like the hill heights, drop heights, masses, and more. If we make one hill too high, that can mess up our whole design because the car will not have enough energy to make it to the end. The same thing goes for many other factors of the roller coaster.\n\nThe mass of the car has a direct relationship with both PE and KE. When one goes up, the other goes up and when one goes down, the other goes down. When the car had a mass of 60kg, the amount of PE was 2932J. When we decreased the mass of the car to 40 kg, the amount of PE decreased to 1955J. The same thing happened to the amount of KE, when the car was 60kg, the KE at the bottom of the drop was 2932J and when we decreased the mass of the car to 40kg, the KE was 1955J. This is why we want a car with the higher mass because then it will have more energy and it will be easier for the car to make it to the end.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "87", "Raw": "64", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.4812", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7339", "Comprehensive": "0.6076", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 10(3), 12(3), 14(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 23(2), 26(2), 27(2), 29(2), 33(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 38(1), 40(1), 42(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 5 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

This is because throughout my experiments the higher the drop the more energy. For example, when I had my drop height at 2 m it only had 930 J of total energy PE (The amount of energy possible that can happen before the drop)+KE (The total amount of energy during the ride).  But when I had my drop height at 5m (with all the other variables the same) there was 2326 J of total energy. So basically the higher the coaster's initial drop the more PE and KE there will be. The more energy the longer, faster, and more exciting the coaster can be, which will ultimately make it more enjoyable.\n \nThe relationship between KE and PE is indirect when one goes up the other goes down because no energy is destroyed which basically means either way the energy transfers from PE to KE or vice versa. PE+KE equals the total amount of energy which will never change unless there is some sort of non usable energy. At the top of the initial drop, the PE is going to be whatever number it is based on the height and theRE will always be 0. As the roller coaster goes through its ride the PE will transfer into KE causing PE to go down and KE to go up, this happens all of the ways to the end of the roller coaster and eventually, PE will be at 1 and KE 1 less than the total amount of energy. Unless there happens to be friction in that case some of the energy transfers into the non700usable energy. Energy transformation happens when there is some sort of nonusable force like friction, the energy than may seem like it disappears but it actually does not it just turns into other types of energy that the roller coaster does not use. \n\nWe know this because of the law of Conservation of Energy, No energy can be created or destroyed. So even though it may sometimes seem that energy may have just disappeared but it didn't all it did was transfer into energy that the roller coaster did not use like heat or sound energy. This is how the roller coaster eventually comes to a stop. \n\nThe relationship between the drop height is quite simple: if the hill height is less than the initial drop height then the coaster will reach the end. If it is the same or more than the initial height drop it won't. I know this because when my initial drop height was 5 and my hill height was three my coaster reached the end with ease, but when both heights were 5 (even) the coaster did not even make it up the hill let alone not reach the end. The more mass the more PE, KE, and total energy. I know this because in my simulation I tried out many different car masses. For example, when my car was 40 kg the PE and KE were 1955 J compared to when my mass was 60 kg my PE and KE was 2933 this means they have a direct relationship when one goes up so does the other. That is all I know about roller coasters and I am eager to find out more.\n\nAfter I have done more research on how height and mass affect speed I have chosen to lower my initial drop height to 3.5 any higher than that will be too dangerous for the passengers. I know this because of the relationship of height and energy, it is direct when one goes up so does the other. I know this because in my trials and simulations when the drop height was at 4m of the initial drop height my car went 8.84 m/s, when I elevated the height to 5 m the car ended up going faster at 9.88 m/s in total speed at the end of the ride. Therefore I know when the height of the initial drop is higher the coaster moves faster.\n\nI have also learned throughout my extensive research how mass and speed are related.  The Mass has no effect on speed. When I elevated the mass the speed stayed the same. For example, I raised my mass from 40-60 and still ended up having the same amount of speed (8.26 m/s). Mathematically the reason mass has no effect on speed or energy is that if you take a look at the formula for KE and PE. They have mass in both of them and assuming there is no friction those equations would have to be equal to each other. So since mass is on both sides you can cancel it out (Subtract it from both sides).\n\nFrom my new research, I now understand how mass and height of the initial drop and hill affect the energy and accelerations of the coaster. I think the best Idea for my design will be to have a 3.5 m initial drop height and then multiple hills and loops ranging from 2-3 m in height. My mass of the car will be 60kg because although mass does not affect speed it does affect energy so the higher mass the more thrilling ride the riders will have.\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "67", "Raw": "61", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.4586", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6995", "Comprehensive": "0.5791", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 9(4), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 21(2), 22(2), 25(2), 27(2), 32(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 38(1), 42(1), 45(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

It should be 5.0 so we have the most amount of speed when the coaster moves to the hill so it can make it over. The higher we have the drop height the more PE the cart will have. In our test when we had the drop height at 5.0m the PE was 1955J, and when we had the height at 4.0m the PE was 1564J. So the higher we make the initial drop the more speed and energy we will have. The more height we more the more PE and KE we will have. The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is that when we add PE and KE together (if there is no friction) they will equal the total energy. The height of the drop relates to PE at the top by PE being a bigger number when the height of the drop is greater. The height of the drop also relates to KE at the bottom by being a bigger number when the height of the drop is greater. \n\nFor the hill, we should make it 4m. We should make it 4m because the hill can be big and the cart can still make it to the end. In our test when we had the hill and starting drop height at 5m the cart didn't make it to the end, but when we had the hill height at 4m and the starting drop at 5m the cart made it to the end. Also at the top of the hill, the cart had 1478J of PE and 480J of KE. So if we have the hill height at 4m the cart can still make it to the end, the hill can be big, and the cart can still go fast. If we have the hill height the same or higher than the initial drop then the cart will not make it to the end. \n\nWe should make the cart's mass 40kg. We should do this so that the cart goes its fastest. In our test when we had the cart at 40kg it had 1958J of PE at the top, and 1953J KE at the bottom, but when we had the cart's mass at 60kg, at the top it had 2937J PE, and 2930J of KE at the bottom. So the more mass the cart has the more PE and KE it has so, we should make the cart 40kg so it will have more speed if we have friction. If there is no friction the mass doesn't affect the speed.\n \nWhen the cart is going down the hill the PE and KE are going down. When the cart gets halfway throw the tract (if there is no friction) the PE and KE should be the same, but after that, the KE will be greater than the PE.\n\nThe more height we have the more speed there will be. So if the height is a bigger number there will be more speed but if it is a smaller number there will be less speed. Also, the Mass of the cart does not affect the speed of the cart. In our test when the cart was 60kg the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.89m/s and at the top of the hill it was 2.11m/s and at the end it was 9.88m/s. When the cart was 40kg the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.89m/s and at the top of the hill it was 2.11m/s and at the end it was 9.88m/s. So the mass does not affect the speed of the cart.\n\nWe should change the start drop height to 3.5m so that the ride will be fun and safe. Also, we would then want to change the hill height to 3m or less.\n\nMass\n\nThe law of conservation says the energy can't be created or destroyd.

I'm gonna start with the initial drop, the initial drop is such a big factor in creating your ride because that's what's gonna get you started. Since we want to make our ride have hills and loops I think a good height would be 5m high because my data shows that when the drop height was 5 and you had 2932j of PE. the higher your initial drop is the more PE you have at the top which will soon transform into KE and we need KE to get over the hills so if we have enough PE at the start then we will hopefully even have extra KE that way we can add more hills and loops! In the law of conservation of energy, it says that energy can't be created nor destroyed it can only be transformed so that's how we know that like I said the more PE we have at the top of the initial drop the more KE we will have as it starts to go down because the PE transforms into KE. \n\nAs far as hill height, the highest it can be is 4m, if we use my data you can see that the highest I made my initial drop was 4m, and once we got to wear the hill height was 4m we notice that the cart had 8j of KE left and it didn't make it over the hill, that's because it didn't have enough KE to make it over so if we do hills that are 2m 3m and 4m then the cart will get over. \n\nFor the mass, my data shows that the more mass the more PE at the top of the drop and the more KE at the bottom of the drop if we take 40kg for instance at the bottom of the hill it had only 1949j of KE but if we compare that to when the cart was 60kg we can see that at the bottom of the drop it had 2923j, so for mass, I think that 50 is probably a good number because it will make you have a fun ride that's pretty fast but not unsafe. \n\nWhen we talk about how height affects PE and KE we know about inverse and direct, If we are talking about how height affects PE we can take my data for example when we put the initial drop at 2m the Pe at the top was 1173 but then when we increased the drop height to 3 we can see that the PE also went up to 1759, and so on until we get 5m high and the PE is 2932 so the more you increase the height the more PE you will have, and then the mire PE you have also the more KE because the law of conservation of energy says that energy can't be created nor destroyed only transformed so the more PE at the top the more KE because the PE will transform into KE. \n\nThe last thing that we need to go over is height, mass and speed, this is the most confusing relashinship in my opinion and i was really surprised with my data on this topic. When we look at mass and speed first we with my data we see that if the mass of the car was 40kg the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.88m/s/s, when we increase the mass to 50kg its the exact same speed 9.88m/s/s. To show proof on why this is happening-when you change mass the speed stays the same, so lets say we have a 10 car and a 20 car with no friction we know it will start with pe and it will end with ke. they will equal eachother, if thats the case because mass is on both sides of the equation we can cancel mass out now we are left with gravity height and 1/2 velocity squared  and we can get rid of 1/2 by multiplying both sides by 2, we can get velocity if we get rid of gravity and height on the other side because velocity is depended on height and gravity, gravity on earth will always be 9.8 now that mass is not in the equation, so if you have height and gravity you can solve to get why it didnt change. If there is friction we cant use this proof.\n\nair resistnace affects the lighter objects more and object that has bigger surface area.\n\nHeight and mass are very different, this time they wont have to same the more you increase it. When we atarted our initial drop at 3m the speed at the bottom of the drop was 7.66m/s/s, and then when we oncreased it to 4m it was 8.84m/m/m. To make this ride safe and fun at the same time we are gonna have to chnage our initial drop height to 3m so the speed stays under 8.4m/s/s, and then with other data about hill heights we know it has to be smaller that the initial drop so the hill height could be 2m, and the mass really isnt gonna matter unless we add friction. \n\nHeight affects PE because the higher up you go the more PE your energy will have stored up so basically in the law of conservation of mass it says energy cant be created nor destroyed so when you have more PE with more height you know your also gonna have more KE because the PE will transform into KE.\n\n ", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "63", "Raw": "34", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.2556", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3899", "Comprehensive": "0.3228", "Content Unit": "3(5), 10(3), 11(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 27(2), 35(2), 38(1), 40(1), 42(1), 47(1), 50(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 40 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... because my data shows that when the drop height was\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 3": "Content Unit: 38 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... have hills and loops and you had j of PE.\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 3 [Weight: 5]\n\tSegment: .................... the higher your initial drop is the more PE you have at the top\n\t         .................... which will soon transform into KE and we need KE to get over the\n\t         .................... hills so if we have enough PE at the start then we will hopefully\n\t         .................... even have extra KE that way we can add more hills and loops!\n\t", "sentence 6 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 27 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... and it did nt make it over the hill, thats because it did nt have\n\t         .................... enough KE to make it over so if we do hills that are m m and m\n\t         .................... then the cart will get over.\n\t", "sentence 7 Segment ID: 3": "Content Unit: 16 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... when the cart was kg\n\t", "sentence 7 Segment ID: 5": "Content Unit: 59 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... , I think that is probably a good number because it will make you\n\t         .................... have a fun ride thats pretty fast but not unsafe.\n\t", "sentence 8 Segment ID: 3": "Content Unit: 60 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... you have also the more KE because the law of conservation of\n\t         .................... energy\n\t", "sentence 8 Segment ID: 9": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... , the Pe at the top was but then when we increased the drop height\n\t         .................... to we can see that the PE also went up to, and so on you will\n\t         .................... have, and then the mire PE says that energy cant be created nor\n\t         .................... destroyed only transformed so the more PE at the top the more KE.\n\t", "sentence 10 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 62 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

This allows you to have the most PE and KE for the rollercoaster. At the top of the initial drop, the car has PE. The more PE you have the more KE you have. So we want as much PE as possible for the most KE possible. PE and KE have a direct relationship. This means when one increases the other increases. We can look at this by changeing the height of the roller coaster's initial drop height. When the initial drop was 3 meters the PE was 1173J. With a 5 meter initial drop, the PE was 1955 J. When you add together PE and KE you get total energy. We want as much total energy as possible because then we can keep the car going for longer. When the car is going down the initial drop its loosing PE. The car is losing PE because its useing it to change into KE. KE is what keeps the car moveing on the tracks and PE is what energy is stored in the car before going down on the tracks or stored at the top of a hill or slope. With PE and KE comes transfermation of energy and the Law of Conservation of Energy. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can not be created n'or destroyed. However, energy can transform into multiple things like heat and sound. Energy transforming takes away PE or KE and we need as much energy as posible. With rollercoasters comes hills. To get over a hill you need KE. We need to make sure that the initial drop is heigher than the first hill to make sure we have enough KE. When I tested the initial drop and hills, I started with a 5 -meter hill and initial drop. The car did not make it over the hill. So I changed the hill height to just 4 meters. The car made it over the hill. DO, keep in mind that I testing this in a frictionless test so we may need to change accordingly. Finally, the car used  to hold passengers. the car mass can affect energy. The more mass you have the more PE you have and the more KE your going to use. With gaining more energy comes more heat and sound energy causing the car to loose some PE and KE, tho this shouldn't be a problem.\n\n\n      After further research, I still believe that the hill height should be 5 meters, and the car should be 40KG. This alows the car to go at a constant fast speed throughout the track. DO Note that mass does not affect speed. Height and mass can affect PE and KE. The more mass you have the more PE your going to have. the more PE you have the more KE you are going to have. Running this simulation the largest car had more PE and KE. Also, the higher up you are the more PE youl have meaning, the more KE youl have. DO Note that this simulation was used in a frictionless atmosphere.\n\n   \n\n     Speed, is also affecting on height and mass. I already stated that mass dosnt affect speed. However, gravity, height, and velocity do. The higher up you are the more PE you have. Meaning the more KE you have. KE is used to gain speed with gravity.\n\n\n     The relationship between PE and KE is a direct relation ship. When you increase PE your going to have more KE when its used. This is also known as the transfer of energy. In this transfer, a car is going down a hill or slope. The Car had stored PE at the top, but now its going down the hill. Its using its stored PE and turns it into other energy's like heat KE and sound energy.\n\n\n    With my design also comes the conservation of energy. The conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed. But when your moveing down a hill where is the KE going?. The KE is being transformed into many thing like heat and sound. its loosing KE but its turning that energy into different forms.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "69", "Raw": "53", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.3985", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6078", "Comprehensive": "0.5031", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 7(4), 15(3), 18(3), 19(3), 29(2), 31(2), 32(2), 33(2), 34(2), 35(2), 38(1), 39(1), 44(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 56(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 6 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: ....................

Also having the hill be the highest point on the roller coaster would mean it would have a greater PE because its higher up which means that when the carts would go down they'd have a greater KE making the ride go faster since energy can't be created nor destroyed so it'll always be there and more fun. I tried this when I made the initial drop height 5 meters which made the cart have a PE of 1955 J and then another trial where the drop height was 4.5 and had a PE of 1759 J. Also if any hill were to be the same height or higher than the initial drop height the ride could come to a complete stop and that'd be a problem. I tried when I made the initial drop 5 meters and the hill height be 5 meters and the cart didn't make it over but it did for the other trials where I made the hill height less than the initial drop height. The way PE and KE works is that when one goes up the other goes down so the PE at the start of the drop is greater than the KE but when the cart goes down the drop the KE increase and the PE decreases almost entirely. Also the carts mass shouldn't be to big either since the cart will end up going slower on bigger hills. Although the more mass a cart has the more energy it has, for example one cart I tried was 50 KG and had a total energy of 2448J and then another one I tried had a mass of 60 KG and had a total energy of 2937J and it went pretty fast down hills.  Also if the higher the initial drop height is then the more speed you'll get because in one trial I made the hill height 5 M and the speed at the end of the ride will be 9.88 m/s and in another trial I had the initial height at 4 m and the speed at the end was only 7.65 m/s. The mass of the car should be higher since in one trial I did the mass of the cart was 60 kg and the speed at the top of the hill was 6.58 m/s and then in another trial I had the mass at 50 kg and the speed at the top of the hill was 6.34 ms so having more mass is better.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "32", "Raw": "23", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 98", "Quality": " 0.2347", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.2638", "Comprehensive": "0.2492", "Content Unit": "3(5), 10(3), 16(3), 18(3), 27(2), 35(2), 50(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 56 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... though the total amount of energy always stays the same since it\n\t         .................... cant be created or destroyed\n\t", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 3": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Kinetic energy is the type of energy related to movement. It's the energy you have when an object is in motion. Potential energy is affected by mass and height. The higher you are in the air and the more mass you have, the more PE you will have. KE is affected by mass because the more mass you have the faster it will go downhill and you will gain more KE by going faster. \n\nThe relationship between PE and KE and TE is that the total amount of energy will never be less or more than you started with. PE and KE are related because when PE goes down KE goes up. When I started with 2140 J of PE and I stopped it halfway down the hill, it was 1070 J on each side because when the PE went down, the KE went up. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can't be created or destroyed which means that my theory of when the car is halfway down the total energy will be equal for PE and KE is correct. \n\nThe relationship between drop height and hill height matters because the car has to make it over the hill. When you drop the car at 2 m off the ground and the top of the hill is 5 m, it's not going to make it over because there isn't enough friction or energy to get over. That's why your initial drop has to be taller or the same height as the hill for it to go over. \n\nThe mass of the car matters because the heavier it is, the harder it is to get over the hills.

When it goes down a hill, it gains more KE and loses PE. That's because PE is affected by height so if you are high in the air you will have lots of PE. If you're sitting on the ground, you will have a low amount of PE.\n\nOur coaster is going to make it to the end because we are using the 50 kg car.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3185f4d8ff4cc29cdb", "class_id": "2", "teacher_id": "JN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "      Our drop height should be 5 meters because it is the tallest height and it then creates the most total energy. The data shows that when the initial drop was 3 meters the PE was 1,759 J, the KE at the bottom of the initial drop was 1,759 J, and the total energy was 1,759J. Then when the drop height was 5 meters the PE was 2932 J, the KE at the bottom of the initial drop was 2932 J, and the total energy was 2932 J. Proving that when the initial drop height is the tallest the roller coaster car will have the most energy making it go farther on the track.\n     The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is that they are always going to end up being the same number when the coaster makes it to the end of the track and when the coaster car is at the top of the track. The data shows that when the car is at the top of a 3-meter initial drop the car has 1,759 J of potential energy. Then when the car makes it to the end of the track it has 1,759 J of kinetic energy, and the total energy is 1,759.\n     When the car is going down the initial drop and is halfway down the PE is going to be going down because it is converting its PE into KE, and the KE is going to be going up because the PE is turning into that KE. My data shows when the car is halfway down a 4-meter drop where the PE at the top of the drop is 2346, the energy at the mid-way point is 1,173 J of both KE and PE because there is still half of that PE to turn into KE.\n     The law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. In our simulation, the car goes down the initial drop but loses its starting potential energy, but due to the Law of Conservation of Energy that potential energy can't just disappear so it turns into kinetic energy when the car goes down the initial drop. Also when the car makes it to the end of the initial drop its total energy will be the same as the starting potential energy.\n     Moving on to the hill of our roller coaster. The hill height of our roller coaster has to be smaller than the height of our initial drop. This is because there is not enough potential energy to get the car over the hill that is taller than our initial drop. My data shows that when the initial drop is 4 meters and the hill height is 3 meters the car has enough potential energy from the start of the initial drop to go up and over the hill. When the initial drop is 4 meters but this time the hill height is 5 meters the car then does not have enough starting potential energy to make it up and over the hill.\n     Let's talk about how mass affects PE and KE? My data shows that when the mass is increased the PE, and KE increase also. When I had a car with a starting mass of 40 kg the PE at the top of the drop its PE was 1957 J and its KE was also 1957 J at the bottom of the initial drop. Then when I increased the mass to 50 kg the PE at the top of the initial drop was 2446 J and the KE was also 2446 J at the bottom of the initial drop. In my final trial where the car mass was 60 kg, the PE at the top of the initial drop was 2936 J and the KE was also 2936 J at the bottom of the hill. My evidence proves that when you increase the mass of the car you will also increase the total energy. \n      Our data shows that when the initial drop is higher the speed increases. When the initial drop height was 3 meters our car had a speed of 7.66 meters per second, when the initial drop height was 4 meters the speed was 8.84 meters per second. Now in order to keep everybody safe, the ride has to have a maximum speed of 8.4 meters per second so we will have to have an initial drop height of 3 meters, unless there is friction to slow our car down then we can probably do 4 meters.\n      Next, we need to pick a mass for our coaster car. Our data shows that when we dropped the car with a mass of 40 kg from a 5-meter tall initial drop the speed at the bottom of our hill was 9.88 meters per second. We then added 10 more kg making our car 50 kg and dropped it from our 5-meter initial drop that also ended up with a speed of 9.88 meters per second. On our last attempt, we added another 10 kg to our car making it 60 kg in total, and dropped it from our 60 kg initial drop and it also had a speed of 9.88 meters per second. This is all showing that when there is no friction mass of the car doesn't matter so we can have a mass of 50 kg.\n      When the coaster car has more mass it makes a greater amount of total energy. And when the initial drop is taller it also creates more total energy. My data shows that when the mass is increased the PE, and KE increase also. When I had a car with a starting mass of 40 kg the PE at the top of the drop its PE was 1957 J and its KE was also 1957 J at the bottom of the initial drop. Then when I increased the mass to 50 kg the PE at the top of the initial drop was 2446 J and the KE was also 2446 J at the bottom of the initial drop. In my final trial where the car mass was 60 kg, the PE at the top of the initial drop was 2936 J and the KE was also 2936 J at the bottom of the hill. \n      Then how does the height of the drop affect the total energy? My data shows that when the initial drop was 3 meters the PE was 1,759 J, the KE at the bottom of the initial drop was 1,759 J, and the total energy was 1,759J. Then when the drop height was 5 meters the PE was 2932 J, the KE at the bottom of the initial drop was 2932 J, and the total energy was 2932 J. Proving that when the initial drop height is higher there will be more total energy.\n      Finally, how does the Law of Conservation of Energy affect our design? Since the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed the energy just changes states from PE to KE. You can't have a hill that is higher than your initial drop because you can't just add more energy to your ride. Therefore everything has to be smaller than the loop, hill, or drop before it.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "85", "Raw": "60", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.4511", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6881", "Comprehensive": "0.5696", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 11(3), 14(3), 15(3), 20(2), 24(2), 26(2), 27(2), 28(2), 29(2), 31(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 37(1), 39(1), 42(1), 43(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 34 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... and it then creates the most total energy.\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 35 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... when the coaster car is at the top of the track\n\t", "sentence 5 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 51 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Because when tested in the trials having the initial drop at 5 meters provided 1955 J of total energy, because when it was at a different height like 4 meters, the total energy it had was 1564 J. So as you can see 5 meters would provide the most total energy or, starting PE and ending KE. \n             Because according to all the data from the trials, the starting PE was always the same number as the total energy, and when the car was at the end of the track the KE was also the same as the total energy. That is because when the car goes down the slope the energy from the starting PE was transforming into the ending KE. But at the same time, the total energy was always the same. This is a good example of the law of conservation of energy, which states that \"energy can not be created or destroyed, merely changed.\" \n            For example, when the trials for the hills started, one of them, when the hill was at 4 meters the PE was at 1908 J at the top of the hill and the KE was 540 J at the top. When you add those two together you will get 2448 J which is the total energy.\n           Now for the hill, I would say 4.75 meters. Because when tested having the hill the same height or taller than the initial drop resulted in the car not being able to get over the hill. So having it at a smaller height like 4.75 meters is a good idea.\n           For the car mass, having it be the heaviest like 60 kg, is the best bet. Because mass is a part of the equation to find PE. That equation is PE = m x h x g. So having a bigger height or mass would mean a bigger PE. Which also translates into having a bigger total energy and a bigger KE. Cause in the data when the cart was at 50 kg, the cart's total energy was 2443 J. Now when it was 60 kg, the cart's total energy was 2932 J. This shows that having 60 kg as the mass would make the car have more PE.\n           Also when having those heights and masses, it would affect the speed. Speed is velocity in one direction so in this case velocity = speed. When finding out if the mass of the car affected its speed of it. The answer was no. Cause during the trials, when the mass was 50 kg the speed at the end of the track was 9.87 m/s. Then when the mass was 60 kg, the speed was 9.87 m/s. The same thing happened when the mass was 40 kg. So that shows that the mass has no effect on the speed.\n          So then if the initial drop affects speed got checked. For that answer, it was yes. So for the trials, it was found that when the drop height is at 4 meters the speed at the end was 8.84 m/s. We then went and checked the speed of the car when the drop was at 5 meters, this time the speed at the end was 9.88 m/s. Which goes to show that the drop height does in fact impact the speed of the car.\n          So when the mass goes up the PE goes up, and when the mass goes up again the KE goes up. Because when there is no friction, the initial PE is the same as the ending KE.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "53", "Raw": "46", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 123", "Quality": " 0.3740", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5275", "Comprehensive": "0.4508", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 13(3), 14(3), 15(3), 17(3), 19(3), 24(2), 27(2), 31(2), 33(2), 34(2), 37(1), 40(1), 42(1), 46(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 27 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

PE and KE are kinda the same thing but just Pe is kinda the energy when your object is the highest point off the ground and not moving, but then when that roller coaster ends and its at the lowest point on the ground you'll have more Ke. \n      Lets say you have the same drop height of 5 but your hill height is the same height you are going to have a struggle getting over that hill, which if you had a hill that was 3m tall you would easily get over it and have more KE at the top of that hill.    \n   the heavier your mass is the more PE it will start with so then you will have more KE too rather than if you had a less weighing cart.

This is shown because, at an initial drop height of 2 m, the PE at the top was 1173 J, and only changing the height to 3 m, the PE at the top was 1759 J. This shows that the higher you make your initial drop, the higher the total energy. Also, PE and KE have an inverse relationship, meaning one goes up while the other goes down. This affects the ride because that means that, if you want more PE, then you will have to give up some KE in order to get that. When the car moves down the hill, the PE will decrease because there is less height, and therefore, less PE. However, the KE will increase because the car is accelerating, and gaining velocity, which increases KE, and height does not. This is shown because, at a height of 4 m, the PE at the top of the drop is 2346 J and the KE at the top is 0 J. But, as the car travels down the drop, the PE converts to KE, and other types of energy if there is friction, so, at the bottom of the track, the PE is 0 J, and the KE is 2346 J. Also, since there is friction, the hill height must be shorter than the initial drop height. This is because the total energy that converts to KE will not be enough to get the car up a hill higher than or as tall as the initial drop. Also, since there is friction, you will only be able to have a limited number of hills and loops before the car runs out of mechanical energy (PE and KE, or energy that is useful). This means that the ride will end when that energy runs out. Finally, even if you have a car with a high mass, it will result in it having more total energy but not more speed. This is shown because, with a 40 kg car, the total energy is 1957 J, and when you only increase the mass to 50 kg, the total energy is 2446 J However, at a mass of 40 kg, the car has a speed of 8.84 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop, 6.24 m/s speed at the top of the hill, and 8.84 m/s of speed at the end of the ride. When you raise the mass to 50 kg, those numbers stay the same, and they are still the same when you raise it to 60 kg. This means that the car with more mass will have more total energy, but the same speed, so mass doesn't affect the car's speed. Finally, the Gonzales family should have a high initial drop, with a small car mass to have less friction, or a large one to have more friction and a limited number of hills and loops that are all shorter than the initial drop height in order to have the best roller coaster they can.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "30", "Raw": "30", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 94", "Quality": " 0.3191", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3440", "Comprehensive": "0.3316", "Content Unit": "3(5), 17(3), 19(3), 20(2), 24(2), 27(2), 31(2), 32(2), 38(1), 42(1), 46(1), 50(1), 52(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 46 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... the height to m, the PE at the top was J.\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

In my data when it was 4 meters tall the PE was at 1955 J but when it was 5 m it had 1443 J of PE. That's why A height of 5 meters is good. \n\nThe conservation of mass states that energy cannot be created. So when our cart goes down the hill and reaches the bottom-most of the hill the PE was transformed to KE which is energy in motion and it will never be more than the total energy which is the PE at the top of the hill. As an example the Total energy was 2443 J so was that for 5 meters and the total kinetic energy in the bottom was 2443 J so no energy was created or destroyed during the cart going down. Because of this, I recommend we use a drop height of 3 because of this it will stay below 7.66 \n\n Now I recommend adding a hill I would say 4 meters. when I tested this when the hill height was 4 meters we had enough kinetic energy from the top of the initial drop to make it over with 583 KE to spare but when we had a hill of 5 meters we had a KE of 0 and it rolled back down. The 4-meter hill also had 2354 J of PE energy to use after the hill like a loop.\n\nNow I recommend that you use a 60-kilogram car because the more mass an object has the more air resistance will be because an object with less mass will face more air resistance slowing it down. Also, the relationship between the mass of the cart and the velocity won't change. The reason why is that velocity is not reliant on mass is when we do the calculation mass cancels itself out. As an example, a 60 kg cart and a 50 kg cart are going to have a speed of 8.84/m pers in a 4-meter drop.\n\nBut for the height when we increase the height we are also increasing the PE and when we increase the PE we are going to get a higher velocity. We also don't want a high enough velocity where it's going to be dangerous like 8.4 m/s. So that's why I recommend a drop height of 3 meters because it has a velocity of 7.66 m/s which is under the danger zone but if we use a 4-meter drop the velocity will be 8.84 which is dangerous.

This is shown when the release height was 5 m and the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was 2443 J making the kinetic energy 2421 J which is bigger than when at the top of the drop when the kinetic energy was at 0 J and at the bottom of the initial drop when the potential energy was at 0 J. \n   \n   Another thing that could help you is knowing how potential energy, kinetic energy and total energy affect your ride. Potential energy is at the top of the ride and it is the amount of energy the ride could have. The kinetic energy is the amount of energy after the drop. Total energy is the same throughout the whole ride and cannot be destroyed but it can be transformed which is the Law of conservation of energy. Potential energy is always bigger at the top and then when the roller coaster goes down kinetic energy at the bottom climbs up and potential energy goes down. (the potential energy is at 0 J at the bottom and kinetic energy is at 0 J at the top)\n   \n   Something else you can do is make the initial drop higher than the hill that way it has enough energy to make it over the hill. When the hill height was 5 m and the initial drop height was 5 m it didn't make it over because the PE at the top of the hill was almost as high as the initial drop (2429 J). The mass also has an impact on the potential energy and kinetic energy because the higher the mass of the car, the higher the potential energy will be at the top and the kinetic energy will be bigger at the bottom. This is shown when the mass was 60 kg and the potential energy was 2937 J and the kinetic energy was 2908 J which is significantly larger than when the mass of the car was 40 kg and the potential energy was 1958 J and the kinetic energy was 1949 J.\n  \n   My last advice for the Gonzales is that the kinetic energy and potential energy change when the car moves down the hill and that affects its speed. When it's going down the hill the potential energy starts to drop and the kinetic energy starts to rise depending on how big the hill is and the friction. \n\n   One thing you don't have to worry about though is the mass of the roller coaster affecting the speed of the ride. When the roller coaster car had a mass of 44 kg it reached a top speed of 9.88 m/s and a car with a mass of 60 kg also reached that same top speed. The height of the roller coaster does affect the speed though. When the roller coaster initial drop was at 2.5 it went 6.99 m/s which is 2.86 m/s slower than when it was at 5 m. \n\n   So to sum up my ideas for the roller coaster you should have a high initial drop height, no friction, the mass of the car doesn't matter, the hills have to be smaller than the initial drop, and you should do all things while knowing that the potential energy, total energy and kinetic energy affect the ride.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "41", "Raw": "68", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 111", "Quality": " 0.6126", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7798", "Comprehensive": "0.6962", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 8(4), 11(3), 13(3), 14(3), 17(3), 19(3), 22(2), 23(2), 27(2), 32(2), 42(1), 46(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 6 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: .................... for you is that the higher potential energy of the initial drop\n\t         .................... means the higher kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 2": "Content Unit: 3 [Weight: 5]\n\tSegment: .................... which is bigger than when at the top of the drop\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 3": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was J making\n\t         .................... the kinetic energy J.\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 56 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

My recommendations include changing the drop height to the highest it can go (5.00 m), have the hill height be shorter than the initial drop (around 4.00 m), and you don't actually need to have the highest mass of the car (the mass of the rollarcoaster car doesn't effect the speed at all). Potential energy is the energy that is stored in a non-moving object and kinetic energy is the energy when something is in motion. If you want more people at your amusement park, you should make these changes that I recommend in this essay. \n\nYou should first make the drop height the highest, which is 5.00 m, or at least higher than the hill's height. Potential energy and kinetic energy move and change during the Rollarcoaster, this is called the Law of Conservation of Energy. The initial drop height of the coaster affects both the potential energy and kinetic energy, the higher the drop height, the more the energy changes and moves between things. By having a high initial drop, you will create higher potential energy which will lead to higher kinetic energy and a higher total energy. To show this, my 1st trial from the Adding Hills Data had a release height of 5.00 m and the potential energy was 2446 J. At the top of the hill, the total energy was 1452 J and the kinetic energy was 995 J.  The higher the initial drop height and the lower the hill is, the more likely the Rollarcoaster car will make it over and to the end. Your Rollarcoaster would be faster and more exciting which will excite people and make them come to your park. . \n\nAnother recommendation I have for the roller-coaster is changing the hill height. If you have the initial drop height at 5.00 m having the hill height be around 4.00 m would be the best height. You don't want the hill to be too close to 5.00 m because then the car may not generate enough speed and energy to get over the hill, even if the drop height is taller. If the hill is as low as it can go it will for sure make it to the end, but that doesn't make for the most exciting ride for all the people visiting your amusement park. My data from the Add a Hill lab shows this. My trial 2 had the drop height of 5.00 m and the lowest hill height which was 2.00 m. The potential energy at the top if the hill was 865 J and the kinetic energy was 1580. It had a total energy of 2445 J and DID make it to the end of the ride. My other trial (trial 4) had a drop height and hill height of both 5.00 m. It didn't make it over the hill or to the end of the ride. \n\nIn addition, in my first essay I wrote about how having the cars mass be heavier the faster and more speed it would generate. I was wrong and learned in the Mass & Speed lab that mass does not affect the speed of the roller-coaster car. On the other hand though, mass effects potential and kinetic energy. The heavier the mass is, the more potential and kinetic energy is created. In all of the trials from the Mass & Speed data I used 40, 50, and 60 kg and I learned that the speed at the bottom of drop (9.88 m/s), the speed at the top of the hill (6.24 m/s), and the speed at the end of the ride (9.88 m/s) were all the same for all 3 trials. In the 1st essay, one of my recommendations were to change the car's mass to be the heaviest, but it actually doesn't matter and affect the speed and energy created. \n\nHeight on the other hand does affect the speed. The higher the drop height is, the more speed the car will have. In trial 3 of the Drop Height & Speed my initial drop height was 5.00 m, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.45 m/s, the speed at the top of the hill was 7.13 m/s, and the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88 m/s. All of the other trials had lower drop heights and the speed was lower also. The higher the drop height, the faster the car would go which is what the people coming to your amusement park want. \n\nWhat I have learned the past few weeks my final recommendations would be having the highest drop height, a lower hill height (around 4.00 m), and the mass of the car doesn't matter. I hope your roller-coaster is successful and the information I have provided you build the best and most enjoyable roller-coaster you can and have ever ridden! \n                                                          \n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "71", "Raw": "64", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.4812", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7339", "Comprehensive": "0.6076", "Content Unit": "0(5), 3(5), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 14(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 23(2), 25(2), 26(2), 27(2), 29(2), 32(2), 33(2), 37(1), 38(1), 42(1), 46(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 25 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

To create a fast and fun roller coaster you need the initial drop height to be the highest that it can be. When you increase the initial drop height, your potential energy at the top of the drop, when the cart is not in motion, increases. For example, when we did tests on potential energy and initial drops, it shows that, when the height was 5m, (the highest height in all of my trials) the potential energy was 2443J at the top of the drop (the highest potential energy from all of my trials). But when the height was 2m, (the lowest height in all of my trials)the potential energy at the top of the drop was 979J (the lowest potential energy in all of my trials). \nThis is the same for kinetic energy except that when the height of the initial drop is higher the kinetic energy will be larger when it is at the BOTTOM of the hill and in motion. For example with the 5m drop, the kinetic energy was 2443J at the bottom of the drop. But with the 2m drop, the kinetic energy was 979J at the bottom of the drop.\n\nKinetic and potential energy, when added together, will always add up to the total energy. This affects the ride because at the top of the drop, no matter what the height is, the kinetic energy will be 0J and the potential energy will be the total energy. At the bottom of the drop, no matter what the height is, the potential energy will be 0J and the kinetic energy will be the total energy. This is the reason why roller coasters are at their fastest speeds at the bottom of the drop and the slowest speeds at the top of the drop.\n\nAs I said, the kinetic and potential energy, when added together, will always equal the total energy. This means that as the car moves down the drop and the hill, the potential energy decreases at the same rate that the kinetic energy increases. But as the car starts going up a hill, the potential energy begins to increase at the same rate that the kinetic energy decreases. \n\nThe Law of Conservation of Energy is the idea that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transferred and transformed. This is why the potential energy and kinetic energy will always add up to the total energy. The energy can transform into all kinds of energy but it will never be destroyed.\n\nThe relation between the initial drop height and hill height is very important when building a roller coaster. The hill height MUST be less than the initial drop height for the car to make it to the end of the roller coaster. For example, my trials when adding hills showed that when I had an initial drop height of 5m and a hill height of 5 meters, it was the only trial where the car failed to make it to the end of the roller coaster. The rest of the trials that had hill heights of 2m, 3.02m, and 4.01meters all made it to the end of the roller coaster.\n\nThe height of the initial drop will be 5 meters, the hill height will be 3.02 meters, and the mass of the car will be 40kg. The height of the initial drop will be 5 meters because when the initial drop is 5 meters the speed will be at it's highest of 9.89m/s. The hill height will be 3.02 meters because it is lower than the initial drop (which causes the roller coaster car to get to the end of the ride) and the speed at the top of the hill, will still be at 6.20m/s. The mass of the car will be 40kg because it should cost less to produce. The Mass of the car does not affect the speed of the ride because in our 4 trials, whether the mass of the car was 40kg or 60kg, the speed was always 9.89.\n\nThe higher the initial drop or hills are, the greater the speed, potential energy, and kinetic energy are. This means that the total energy is also greater than the height is greater. This is shown in my data above. The mass however does not affect the speed (as shown in my data above) but it does affect the potential, kinetic, and total energy. For example, my trials while changing the mass of the cart show that when the car mass was 60kg the total energy was 2933J, and when the mass of the car was 40kg the total energy was 1957J. \n\nFor the last time, when potential energy and kinetic energy are added together, they equal the total energy. So if the total energy goes up, that means the potential energy and kinetic energy are also going up. The potential, kinetic, and total energy can be affected by height and mass, while the speed can only be affected by height.\n\nThe Law of Conservation of Energy affects my design decisions because the higher my initial drop is, the more potential and kinetic energy it will have. When the potential energy transforms into kinetic energy instead of being destroyed, speed occurs, which makes this ride very fun and fast.\n\nIn Conclusion, my roller coaster will be the fastest and safest roller coaster. I know this because of all the data I collected about energy, mass, height, and speed.\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "69", "Raw": "83", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.6241", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.9518", "Comprehensive": "0.7879", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 13(3), 14(3), 15(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 23(2), 25(2), 27(2), 31(2), 32(2), 35(2), 42(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 11 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: ....................

Most people think you need loops to make it look cool but i personally think that the biggest thing of a roller coaster is the initial drop, it brings the thrill to the ride. Also a fun part of a roller coaster are the hills i love larger hills then smaller hills. \n\n     In my initial height experiment i found that when having a higher initial drop there was more Potential energy than the heights that didn't have a high drop. When my initial drop was 5 the PE was 2443 and when my drop was 2.94 the PE was 1436. When there was more PE that means that there will be more kinetic energy, witch shows that the roller coaster will go over the hills if they are high because there will be a lot of speed from the PE and KE. Also when the PE and KE energy is added up the sum of the number is the total energy through the ride. \n\n     In the hill experiment i found that having a higher initial drop like 5 the hill height has to be less than 5 because if it is over 5 it wont be able to go over the hill and it would roll back, witch no one want when all they want to do is have fun. when having a higher initial drop the more PE energy and total energy. when the hill height was 2 the total energy was 2446 and when the hill height was  4.53 the total energy was 2448. \n\n     The mass effects the PE and KE because when the cart is heaver there is more PE because when it goes down the initial drop, it will stay on the track and move down faster becuase there is more PE energy in a higher drop than a low drop.\n\n     When you create your drop height you should have it the highest you can, like 5m because it will create the fastest speed for to roller coaster to be. like in trial 1 the height frop was 5 the speed at the end of the ride it was 9.88, and in my second trial the initial drop height was 3.54 and that was the lowest initial drop height i did and i got 8.32 for the total energy at the end of the ride. This is showing that when having a high initial drop it makes the speed through out the roller coaster. \n\n     When building a roller coaster you may think about the how much the car has to weigh and see if it will effect the speed of the cart.

As long as the initial drop is higher than the hill the roller coaster would be able to get over, the potential energy (J) is very high 2446 - 2449 to every hill height, Kinetic energy (J) is at the top of the hill is 1 - 1228 (J), and the total is from 2446-2450 ( total energy). And for the mass and energy, the higher mass = higher total energy example 60 car mass= 1840 total energy, and a car mass of 40 = 1226 total energy. Height affects PE, KE, and PE  has most of the energy before the initial drop and while it is going up the hill it's KE, and then when it stops the KE is still higher than PE in the law of conservation of energy.\n\n\nAs for the drop height & speed for the Gonzales family, the initial drop the higher the height is in meters the more speed the car will have at the end of the ride. For example, in the first test trial, the height of the initial drop was 3.30 and the speed was 8.02, for the last test trial the height was 5 meters and the end speed was 9.88 (m/s). The initial drop should be the 5 so the ride is fast and safe.\n\n\nAs for the mass and speed of the Gonzales family roller roster, the mass should not affect the speed of the roller roster at the end of the ride.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "6278bd4757433ebc821c6c16", "class_id": "1", "teacher_id": "JB", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "Dear Gonzales Family,\n\nAs a roller coaster expert, here is what I am suggesting to you. There are specific statistics you need to have to build a successful coaster. The initial drop needs to be a specific height, and the hill height needs to accommodate that. If you want the most thrilling experience for your guests, the mass of the cart riding on the tracks needs to be heavy. Here are my findings.\n\nFor your initial drop, you want it really as high as you can get it. With more potential energy, the more kinetic energy it will produce. When I tested the simulation, I set the initial drop height to 5 meters, and the potential is 2444 J. The kinetic energy is 0 J because the car is not in motion. While the car is moving, that helps it gain more and more kinetic energy. When it's at the bottom of the hill, the potential energy is now 0 J while the kinetic energy is 2444. When I set the height of the initial drop at 2.3 meters, the potential energy at the top was only 1127 J. Kinetic energy was 0 J, and it was the opposite at the bottom of the hill like the 5 meter trial. I noticed that the potential energy at the top of the drop is always the opposite of kinetic energy. The total energy will always be the same, whatever the amount of Jules of potential energy is at the top of the initial drop. The higher the total energy, the faster your car will go. Even though the number of Jules is not changing, it is transferring from potential energy to kinetic energy. This is the Law of Conservation of Energy, the amount of Jules aren't being created or taken away, but it is just being put into different \"groups,\" the groups being potential and kinetic energy.\n\nWhen thinking about the hill height for your roller coaster, having it at a lower height than the initial drop is the best option. If the hill is the same or taller than the initial drop, your car won't make it all the way over. Unless you want a roller coaster that goes backwards and gets stuck at the bottom, I wouldn't advise this idea. It won't have enough kinetic energy to make it over the hill, because the amount of potential energy at the top of the hill is higher than the amount at the initial drop. The total energy for the hill height can't be larger than the total energy for the initial drop. If you would want the car to get stuck in between the initial drop and hill height, you would need to have some sort of mechanism to carry the cart up to the top of the hill and to continue the ride. When I tested this theory, I set my initial drop height to 5 meters. That was my controlled variable, it never changed throughout the whole simulation. When I set my hill height to 5 meters, the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was 2449 J. When it got to the top of the hill, the potential energy was also 2449 J, while the kinetic energy was 0 J. The reason this happened is because the car never made it past the hill. It had no motion, therefore the kinetic energy was at 0 J. But when I set the initial drop height to 2 meters, the potential energy was 2445 J. When it got to the hill, the potential energy was 982 J, while the kinetic energy was 1463 J. Because the hill was a great amount shorter than the initial drop, the car just kept moving right over the hill. The kinetic energy is higher than the potential because the car doesn't have to slow down to get over the hill, it can just basically ride smoothly over the top.\n\nWhen you are deciding the mass of your car, it should be the greatest it can be, if you want the most velocity out of the ride. If the car is heavy, it will go faster down the hill, it will have the most potential energy. When the car is going faster it transfers to kinetic energy. When I set my car mass to 60 kg, the potential energy at the top of the drop was 2937 J, while the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop was 2638 J. Very close numbers. When I set the mass of the car to 40 kg, the potential energy was only 1958 J, and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1955 J. When the mass of the car is higher, the more potential energy it will have, and the more that it has is the faster it will go, which will then create kinetic energy. It doesn't make more energy, but it transfers from potential to kinetic.\n\nThe height of the initial drop can affect the speed of the ride. Say the mass of the car is 60 kg. I chose this before the Mass and Speed simulation, and I thought that the heavier the car, the faster it will go. That is not the case now that I have done both simulations and experiments. If it is getting dropped from an initial drop of 5 meters, it will go faster than the same car getting dropped at a 4.25 meter drop.  When the car was dropped from 5 meters, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.89 meters per second, while when it got dropped at 4.25 meter drop, it was only 9.11 meters per second. This is because gravity is pushing the car down towards ground level. When the car is getting dropped from a higher level than another, it will just generally go faster because it needs to get to ground level faster. I did notice in the simulation that the total energy was the same as the speed at the bottom of the drop. At the initial drop height of 4.35 meters, both total energy and speed at the drop height was 9.11 meters per second. The speed at the top of the hill kept going down with the initial drop height. Whenever the drop height went down, the speed at the top of the hill did too. \n\nWhen it comes to choosing the mass for your car, in a friction less environment, it doesn't matter what the mass is. Mass doesn't affect speed because the mass gets taken completely out of the equation. It gets cancelled out of both sides when you are solving for velocity. No matter the mass of the car, because there is no friction, the mass doesn't have anything to do with it. Friction plays a big part in this. Without friction, the mass doesn't matter. When the initial drop height is set at 5 meters, and the mass of the car is 60 kg, the speed at the bottom of the drop is 9.89 meters per second. When the mass of the car is set to 40 kg, the speed at the bottom is also 9.89 meters per second. For all 4 trials in this simulation, the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88 meters per second. That's because the mass of the car doesn't matter if there is no friction. It is all still the same. \n\nWhen making this roller coaster, keep the Law of Conservation of energy in mind. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it is being transferred from potential energy to kinetic energy. The total energy will always be the same amount, it just depends on if it is potential energy or kinetic energy. These are my findings from the simulation. I hope you take these ideas into consideration while making a thrilling roller coaster. Let me know if you have any questions, and good luck with your coaster!\n\nSincerely,\nNatalie Towns", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "116", "Raw": "85", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.6391", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.9748", "Comprehensive": "0.8069", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 9(4), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 14(3), 15(3), 16(3), 19(3), 20(2), 22(2), 23(2), 23(2), 27(2), 29(2), 33(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 49(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 27 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... and the hill height needs to accommodate that.\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 16 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... , the mass of the cart riding on the tracks needs to be heavy.\n\t", "sentence 7 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 60 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The hill on a roller coaster can not exceed the initial drop because the KE energy needed to get over the hill would be more than the PE at the top of the initial drop. And because PE becomes KE there would not be enough energy. and this is supported by my data from the experiment from Add a hill. when the hill was .1 meters taller than the drop and the cart failed to make it over the hill. so I suggest that you make the hill just a smidge shorter than the initial drop so that the car will make it over. and increasing the mass of the cart may increase the PE but it still won't help the vart get over the hill because the force of gravity affects the cart more because its heavier so they KE that you need to get over the hill isn't enough. though you could use other types of energy to help boost the coaster but let's focus on PE and KE.as long as the PE at the top of the drop is higher than the KE required to get up the hill the coaster will make it over. and to make it more exciting add a jump at the end or something or a loop. but make sure the PE at the top of the hill is higher than the KE required for any other things you make.  so my design will have an initial height of 5 and a hill of 4.9 meters tall. the weight of the coaster does not affect speed because even though the PE and KE of a coaster are higher on a heavier coaster it doesn't matter because the effect gravity has on it is higher so speed stays the same.  but i do recommend a heavier model because it will probably hold more people and is more sturdy probably. now I decided to make the hight of the hill and initial drop 5 and 4.9 because that will result in more KE PE and speed in total and this is supported because PE and KE added together make TE and the higher the drop the more energy their is and this is supported by my data from section 1 initial drop where when the drop was 5 meters tall it had the highest of 2442J of TE while when the drop was 2 meters tall it only had 977J of TE. and we can also find that mass does not affect speed from our data too because no matter the mass the speed was always 9.89J. and we want the height to be 5 because the higher the height the more speed it has and this is supported by when the height was at its highest of 5 its speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.89J while when it was at 3.04 meters tall it had 7.7J of speed.in conclusion, the height of the coaster should be 5 and the hill should be 4.9 to result in the most fun ride with the highest speed energy and enjoyability possible.

When the car mass the potential energy, kinetic energy and total energy shows its relationship by the kinetic energy is 8.84J and then 8.84J the energy went up 1J for example the kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop was 8.84J and the number went up by 1J to 8.84J with is the total energy of the drop data. When the car moves down a hill the PE+KE shows their change of energy in mass for example the hill height is 5m and the potential energy of the top of the initial drop of 8.84J the potential energy of the hill is 8.84J and the hill was two high for the roller coaster to reach the top and make it over the hill but as the hill got smaller the rest of hill height in the data the car could make it over the hill. Energy transformation and the law of conservation relates  by it can/cant be destroyed but it can be transformed in to potential energy or kinetic energy. The relationship between the initial drop height and the hill height is the higher the hill height is the roller coaster cant make it over the hill because the hill is to high and the  roller coaster will roll back and friction will not be fast enough to make it to the the top of the hill for example when the hill height is 5m the roller coaster will not make it to the top of the hill  but the speed os 9.88m will make it over the hill. The relationship between mass, potential energy+kinetic energy is potential energy is the amount stored energy that a object not in motion  and kinetic energy is energy that something is moving for example when the car mass is 60kg the potential energy is 8.84J and the top of the initial drop and the KE is 8.84J with is the same but the total energy is 8.84J. \n\nfile:///home/chronos/u-11040b924d22d1619ba09802248c612c3552aec0/MyFiles/Downloads/Screenshot%202022-05-25%201.03.29%20PM.png", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "30", "Raw": "46", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 94", "Quality": " 0.4894", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5275", "Comprehensive": "0.5084", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 18(3), 20(2), 27(2), 32(2), 35(2), 42(1), 46(1), 50(1), 51(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 18 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... m The hill height was.\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 46 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... than the next hill drops m for example the potential energy drops\n\t         .................... by then the kinetic energy\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 2": "Content Unit: 3 [Weight: 5]\n\tSegment: .................... why i chose this combination was that the initial was that the\n\t         .................... hill height was less\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 3": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... the reason goes down form the potential energy.\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 1 [Weight: 5]\n\tSegment: ....................

The more height there is the more PE at the bottom and KE at the bottom. PE and KE both relate to the height and mass of the roller coaster. The more height the more PE and KE and total energy, also as the cart on the roller coaster get near the bottom there will be more KE than PE. If there is more height, there also is more mass, if there is more mass there is more than likely more PE and KE. If there is a huge roller coaster then there is more PE and KE at the bottom. When the roller coaster is going down the KE is going to rise because they are getting closer to the bottom. If the cart on the roller coaster was at the top there would be an equal amount of PE, but not KE based on the data that I took. Also if the drop was high but the hills were higher, then the car wouldn't have an easy time going through the whole track being able to get to the bottom. So you would need to have the drop be higher than all of the hills so it would have enough force to go through all of the track. I think there should be a drop height of 5m. Because based on my data if there is a higher drop than the hills on the track the car should be able to make it through the tracks. The law of conversation of energy also states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only transform into another. Mass can affect PE by having more mass meaning it can have more PE. If the mass is bigger then there would be more PE up top and more KE at the bottom. PE and KE can be related from when there is more mass, there is more PE at the top and more KE at the bottom. They can relate to how much mass there is. The more mass the more PE at the top and more KE at the bottom. PE changes when the car moves uphill. KE changes when the car moves downhill. Our team's roller coaster will make it to the end because of the height, and mass. But the mass doesn't affect the speed. It's a certain amount of gravity on it. It will be safe because there are no sharp turns at all. The law of conservation of energy affects our ride because the energy in it cannot be created or destroyed. Same thing with friction., it cannot be created or destroyed. We chose a mass of 50 and max height because, for one thing, we knew mass did not affect the speed of the roller coaster at all based on our research. So it didn't matter much to us about what the mass of the cart was going to be. We chose max hill height because height does affect velocity and we wanted our roller coaster to go super fast so it can be fun for the riders. Height can affect PE by having more height at the top is more PE at the top. Having more height at the bottom gives more KE at the bottom. Mass does not affect the total amount of PE, but it does affect KE. As the hill goes up KE decreases and PE increases. As the hill goes down PE decreases and KE increases! KE at the bottom and PE at the top are related because PE increases when it gets near the top and KE Increases when it gets near the bottom. If there is more mass, there is more KE at the bottom. As the car moves uphill. KE decreases. As the car moves downhill, KE increases. KE is the energy that an object has because of its motion. The faster an object moves, the greater the KE. An object that is not moving has 0 KE. PE is the energy that is stored in an object. The work input into a system is stored as PE. If you push a spring, you are doing the work. The work that you do is then stored in a compressed spring. When the spring decompresses it uses the stored potential energy to do work, such as pushing another object. There's also gravitational PE that is affected by the gravity.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "59", "Raw": "54", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 129", "Quality": " 0.4186", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6193", "Comprehensive": "0.5189", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 5(4), 9(4), 10(3), 11(3), 18(3), 19(3), 24(2), 31(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 39(1), 42(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 9 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: ....................

Then with a hill height of 3, the roller coaster will be able to make it over the hill with no complications and still get through a loop height of 2.5 and make it to the end of the coaster. Moving onto mass my team and I think the best mass would be 60kg for the carts because they would be able to withhold more mass and since mass doesn't change the speed it's not going to make the roller coaster faster. \nNow that we've gone over my team's final decisions for the best height and mass we can talk about their relations of them to PE and KE (Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy). We chose our height as 3.75 for the initial drop because if we had more height the more PE we would've had. With more PE at the top, it would've converted into more KE. More KE means more motion which speeds up the roller coaster thus making it unsafe for passengers. By the end of the ride, the energy will in fact slow down because some of the energy will not get transferred from PE to Ke but instead heat, and sound energy, which makes the total energy a bit less than at the start. Remember just because the roller coaster \"loses\" energy doesn't mean it's gone, it's just getting transferred into a few different types of energy just as PE got transferred to KE. Energy cannot be destroyed nor created. Also if we compared PE to and KE at the bottom, the KE will be zero and the PE should be less than the original considering the cart is now on a higher level as it was on the drop or hill. Adding on to this the PE affects the Ke by transferring the energy to KE, aking potential energy and using it as motion energy and a bit of sound and heat energy.\nSo if we go over my suggestions for the roller coaster, the best height for the drop and hill would be 3.75 and 3 for the hill. This is better so it doesn't exceed the speed limit.

The KE at the bottom of the initial height with the initial height was 3m the KE at the bottom would be 1700J and so if the initial drop was at 5m the KE at the bottom would then also increase to 2833. So the higher the initial drop is the higher the PE is at the top and the higher the KE is at the bottom of the initial drop and energy can't be destroyed so whenever the PE is greater the KE will also become greater because energy can't be destroyed, but the KE will never be greater than the PE because energy also can't be created.\n\n   Let's say the initial drop is 5m, you would have a 2834J of PE at the top and by the time you get to the bottom you would have the same amount of energy but it would all change to KE and so the KE went from 0J to 2834J because energy can't be created or destroyed so by the end of the ride the total energy will be the same amount you started with just all KE and not PE anymore.\n\n   When you're at the top of the initial drop all the energy is PE and the higher you are the more PE you have, and the closer you are to the ground the more KE you have and the less PE you have. When at the top of the initial drop all the energy will be PE and so when you're going down the hill that PE will start transferring into KE until you get all the way to the bottom, all the PE will be gone and it will all be KE, but the total amount of energy will still be the same amount that you started with.\n\n   When there is more mass in the cart the more energy you will have more PE and KE and if you do mxgxh you will get a higher number representing PE and if your do 1/2xmxv^2 you will also get a higher KE.

Potential energy is the energy held by an object because of its position and kinetic energy is energy that possesses due to its motion. When I was doing the initial drop trials I first had the height at 5 m, the potential energy at the top was 2443 J, and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2442 J. When I had the drop height at 3 m the potential energy at the top was 1466 J, and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1465 J. This shows that the higher the height is the more potential energy it has at the start and the more kinetic energy it has at the bottom of the roller coaster. \n\nThe law of conservation of energy says that energy can be transferred but not created nor destroyed. Potential energy and kinetic energy transform back and forth into each other throughout the roller coaster. In my initial drop trial, the potential energy at the top of the drop at 4 m was 1955 J, the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop was 1954 J, and the total energy was 1955 J. This shows that the potential energy transformed into kinetic energy throughout the roller coaster, and the total energy stayed the same. When the cart is going down the initial drop some of the potential energy starts changing into kinetic energy. During my add a hill trial where I had the hill height at 3, the PE at the top of the hill was 1472 J and the KE was 975 J. This shows that the potential energy had started changing into kinetic energy when it went down the initial drop. \n\nThe hill height should be between 2-4 m because the hill height needs to be smaller than the initial drop height so the cart will be able to make it to the end. And, the mass of the cart should be 55 kg so it will have more PE and KE. When I had the mass at 50 kg the potential energy was 2446 J at the top of the drop and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2442 J. This shows that the higher the mass is the more kinetic energy and potential energy there will be. \n\nThe height of the initial drop should be 3.50 m so that the speed is below 8.4 m/s. Mass does not affect speed. For the mass & speed trial, I first put the cart at 40 kg and the max speed was 8.26. Next, I put the mass of the cart at 50 kg, where the max speed was also 8.26. This means mass does not affect the speed in a frictionless environment. \n\nAt the beginning of the roller coaster there is only potential energy, then as the ride goes on it transfers into kinetic energy, then potential, then kinetic, until the ride stops. This is only in a frictionless environment. When there is friction potential and kinetic energy don't just switch back and forth. They change into other types of energy like sound or thermal. This is because the law of conservation of energy says that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transferred.

Also, according to the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed so when the potential energy decrease as it goes down the hill the energy will transfer to kinetic energy and will increase the speed of the car so it has a better chance of making it to end.\n Potential, Kinetic, and Total energy all affect the ride because potential energy which is stored energy will be the starting amount of energy, and since energy cannot be created or destroyed also means that it will also be the total energy at the beginning and the end of the ride since at the moment the car is not moving so there is no kinetic energy. Then as the car moves potential energy transfers to kinetic energy since it is now moving but will still have the same amount of total energy because none of the energy will go away. \nPotential energy and kinetic energy change throughout the whole ride, at the initial drop there is only stored energy or PE so there will be no Kinetic energy at the start. Then as the car goes in motion there will be less stored energy and more energy of motion so potential energy will transfer to kinetic energy and so the PE will decrease and the KE will increase. \nI think the initial drop height should be higher than the hill height. I think the hill height should be 2 meters because it will have the most kinetic energy to keep it going. With an initial drop height of 5m and a hill height of 2 m, there will be 1462J of kinetic energy which is more than all of the other trials. When the drop height is 5 meters that will give you the most potential energy which also will then transfer into more kinetic energy as it moves, but if you add a hill the PE and KE will change a little bit more throughout the ride. If you want a rollercoaster to be fun and exciting usually you add hills and loops and you need as much potential energy and kinetic energy as you can get. A height of 2 meters will give you 1462J of kinetic energy at the top of the hill which will give you enough kinetic energy to make it over the hill and add more hills and loops to make the rollercoaster more fun and exciting. \nThe mass of the car should be 60 kilograms because it gives you 2936J of potential energy at the top and 2930J of kinetic energy as it is in motion. The masses that are less than 60kg all had less potential and kinetic energy so they wouldn't make it as far as the 60kg car and when you add loops and hills you need as much kinetic energy as you can get so that the car will make it to the end. The more mass there is the more potential energy you start off with to get more kinetic energy as it moves. When there is more mass there will be more potential energy because there is more mass that will be pushing with gravity as the car goes down. That also means that since there is more potential energy at the start there will be more energy to transfer into kinetic energy as it moves, so this means that mass has a direct relationship with potential energy at its initial drop and with kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop. \nI believe that the height of the initial drop should be 5m because in the trial it has 9.88 m/s as its speed at the bottom of the drop and 7.66 m/s at the top of the hill which was the fastest speed out of all of the trials. I also think that mass should be 60 because it's kind of in the middle and since mass doesn't affect speed it shouldn't really matter. In the trials, the masses we used were 40kg, 50kg, and 60kg. In all three trials, they started out with 8.56 m/s at the bottom of the drop, then at the top of the hill, they were all 3.8 m/s. They also ended with 8.55 m/s at the end of the ride so therefore there was no change so the mass should not affect the speed.\nThe law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. This means that the design is affected because you aren't able to give it energy as the car goes into motion. There needs to be enough potential energy at the beginning to convert into kinetic energy so you are able to have the car make it to the end.

And if you have a higher PE while your ride is going more PE will be transferred into KE which the more KE you have the farther and faster the ride will be able to go. Like in one of my trials when I started with a lower height like 2m I only had 973J of PE which made the KE only increase u to 972J while the ride ended. Then in another trial, I started with an initial drop of 2.5m so I had 1216J of PE and at the end, I had 1215J of KE. The Higher the initial drop is again the higher the PE will be at the start and because there is no KE at the top the Total energy will always stay at 973J. This is according to the law of conservation of energy, energy can not be created or destroyed. The total amount of PE and KE added up will be the same the whole ride. So because the PE is high at the top of the drop and the KE is high at the bottom energy and can never be created or destroyed the PE transfers over into KE during the ride Causing the PE to decrease and the KE to increase. But the initial height isn't the only thing that impacts the height the car mass also does. The more mass the car has the height the PE will be at the beginning which would lead to more KE. So the more mass the more PE which means More KE. At the top of the hill, you will have a certain PE, and if you add a hill that is lower than the initial drop height your car will be able to make it over the hill because the PE will be able to transfer over into enough KE to make it over the hill. But if you had a hill that was higher the Initial drop of the PE at the start will not be able to transfer into enough KE to make it over the hill. I know this because in my first trial I started with an initial drop of 3 and a hill height of 2 and the car was able to make it over. But in my third trial, I also had an initial drop of 3 but I also had a heel height of 3 and the car was not able to make it over the hill. PE at the top of the hill and KE at the bottom of the hill are related greatly because it is the same energy. They are the same Joules that just transferred over from one kind of energy to the next. I know this because in one of my trials I started with 1459J of PE and OJ of KE and then once the car got to the bottom the PE decreased to only 1J and the KE increased up to 1458J.\n\nsecond essay:\n\nYour initial drop height should be 3.75m, your hill height should be 3m, and the mass of the car should be 55kg because with these the car will make it through the whole ride quickly and safely according to are test trials. \n\nWith no friction, the PE at the top of the hill whatever it is will transfer into exactly the same amount of KE at the bottom of the hill. This is because at the top the car is not moving so it has no KE  and all the energy is PE. At the bottom when it all transfers it has no PE because it has no height and it is all KE because the car is moving.\n\nThe inial drop height and the mass of the car affect the PE and KE. This is because the more height and/or car mass you have the more PE you will have and when you have more PE because there is no friction the KE will also increase. I know this because in a trial I did I started with 40kg and had a PE of 1173J and then I increased the mass to 50kg and then I had 1467J of PE so when I increased the mass I have more PE. And with the height in a trial I did I started out with a drop height of 2m and I had a PE of 973J. Then when I increased the height to 3 I had a new PE of 1459J. So if I increase the height of the drop or the mass of the car it will increase the PE and the KE.\n\nHeight does affect speed because if you have a greater initial drop height your car will have a greater speed. I know this because in my first trial I start with an initial height of 3m and at the end had a speed of 7.65. Then in my 3rd trial, I increased my initial drop height to 5 and had an end speed of 9.38.\nBut mass does not affect speed because there is no friction the PE at the beginning will be the same as the KE at the end. So the equations m x g x h and 1/2 x m x v squared will equal the same and because the mass will be the same during the whole ride the mass will not affect the equations because they will cancel out in the equations no matter the weight of the car. So mass does not affect speed.\n\nThe law of Conservation of Energy plays in my design because the law states energy can not be created or destroyed and because there is no friction all the energy will stay eighter in PE or KE form. So it affects the coaster because there will always be some kind of energy on my coater car.\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "75", "Raw": "52", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.3910", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5963", "Comprehensive": "0.4937", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 21(2), 22(2), 27(2), 29(2), 33(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 42(1), 44(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... because the higher the initial drop height the higher the PE will\n\t         .................... be at the start\n\t", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 15 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... first essay: Your drop height should be meters.\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 35 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... if you have a higher PE while your ride is going more\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 27 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... when I started with a lower height like m which made the KE only\n\t         .................... increase u to J while the ride ended\n\t", "sentence 7 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 44 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3185f4d8ff4cc29d07", "class_id": "3", "teacher_id": "JN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "I think the initial drop height should be 3.5 meters this is because when the height of the initial drop was 3.5 meters the speed was 8.27 m/s  at the bottom of the initial drop but when the drop height was 4 meters the car had a speed of 8.84 m/s. 8.84/s is over the max speed of 8.4 m/s which is the max speed before the passengers are not safe. But 8.27 m/s is right under the speed before which the car is not at a safe speed but is also above the fun speed of 6.7 m/s making the ride fun and safe. The hill height should not be over 3 meters because when the hill height was 5 meters the same as the initial height drop the car did not make it to the end of the ride but when the hill height was 4 meters and the initial drop was 5 meter the car could make it over the hill. This means any hill or loop whose apex is over the initial drop the car will not make it. This makes the initial drop and 3.5 and the hill 3 meters perfect because it will have a speed that is not dangerous and the car will make it over the hill. But this only happens if there is no Since mass doesn't affect speed we think the mass should be 60 kg because then we can have more passengers\n\nwhen the height of the initial drop was 3 meters the PE was 1466 J and at the bottom, the Ke was 1466, but when the Release height was 4 meters the PE was 1955 J and the Ke at the bottom of the initial drop was 1955. The reason the energies are the same is that when at the top of the initial drop the car has no motion so there won't be any Ke, if there is no fiction all that energy will be KE because of the car height but when at the bottom of the initial drop the PE will be 0 because it has no height and because the car has no friction the energy will switch between Pe and Ke, so the energy will transfer from Ke from Pe, there for the car will have the same KE at the bottom as the car has Pe at the top. This means the car had more energy the higher the drop and the more speed it will have to get over hills which makes the run more exciting. We should also add a hill of no more than 5 meters or else it will stop according to my data. When the initial drop was 5 meters and the hill height was 5 meters the cart did not make it to the end. This is because The Law of Conservation of Energy says, energy is not created nor destroyed energy only changes forms. So the cart will not be able to just make the energy to push itself above the 5 meters. When the initial drop height was 4 the PE was 1955 J and the KE was 0 J at the bottom, the KE was 1955 J and the PE was 0. The total energy stayed the same in 1955 so there for the cart's energy stayed the same making it impossible to make it up the hill if it was the same height as the initial drop. We believe we should also add a loop for more excitement, this will work as long as the apex of the loop is lower in height (meters) this is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. We also believe that The Mass of the car should be 60 kg, this is because the more mass an object has the more energy(J) it has. For example, when the mass of the car was 50 kg the PE was 2446 J, but when the car was 60 kg the PE was 2936J. So the more Mass the car has the more energy the car will have which is a direct relation. Also when The hill height was 4 meters the Pe at the top of the hill was 1955 J and the KE was 0 J but at the bottom of the initial drop the PE was 0 J and The Ke was 1955 J. This only happens in a frictionless environment but This means the Pe is the same as the Ke at the bottom. When there is more mass there is more Pe and Ke. For example, when the mass of the car was 60 KG the Pe was 2936 J but when the mass of the car was 50 Kg the car had a Pe of 2446 J.\n ", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "57", "Raw": "54", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 127", "Quality": " 0.4252", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6193", "Comprehensive": "0.5222", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 27(2), 28(2), 31(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 38(1), 42(1), 44(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 3 [Weight: 5]\n\tSegment: ....................

When designing the roller coaster we had to think about how the drop height would affect the PE and KE. We figured out that the higher the drop height the more PE and KE there would be. At the drop height of 5, the PE at the top of the drop was 2834, whereas the PE at the drop height of 2 was 1134.  \nThe drop height and hill height also affect how much KE there will be. If the drop height is 5 and the hill height is 3 the KE at the top of the hill will be 1142. But if you were to have a drop height of 5 and a hill height of 5 the KE at the top of the hill would be 37, not even enough to get the cart over the hill. \nStaying with the topic of the initial drop, how does the PE transfer into KE going down the drop? If you started at the top of a drop with a height of 5, the potential energy at the top of the drop was 2834, but as the cart goes down the drop that energy transforms into KE. So in the middle of the drop, the KE and PE would be 50/50, but by the time you get to the bottom of the drop, you would have 2834 joules of KE. \nThe law of conservation of energy states that no energy is lost, it is just transformed into a different kind of energy, this applies to the roller coaster because at the start the roller coaster has PE, but as it goes down it becomes KE. This shows how the energy transforms into other energy. \nThe mass also affects the PE and KE, the more mass the roller coaster has the more PE and KE the coaster will have. If you have a car mass of 40, the KE is 1946 and the PE is 1949. But as the mass gets greater the PE and KE grow to. So if you have a mass of 60, the KE is 2933 and the PE is 2938. \nThe total energy is also changed when you have more KE and PE. Because the total energy is KE and PE added up, that means the more PE and KE you have then the more total energy you will end up with. \n\nOur team decided to change our height to 3.75 because if will use the original drop height of 5 the speed would be too fast. If we had a drop height of 5 the total speed would end up being 9.88, and we were not allowed to go past the speed of 8.4. We also decided to have our hill height be 3, because then the cart will have enough energy to get over the hill. And that is the same for the loop, it will be changed to 2.75. We also learned in our trials that mass does not affect energy, but it does affect PE and KE. The more mass you have the more PE and KE you will have to because mass is in the equation for PE and KE. Therefore it affects both of them. That goes for height too, because height is in the equation to find both KE and PE, it also affects both of them. \n\nWhen people look at roller coasters they think of speed, but what really affects the speed? Height affects the amount of speed the roller coaster will have. If the height of your initial drop is 3, and you get to the bottom of that drop the speed would be 7.66. But if you were to drop from a height of 5, the speed would be 9.83 by the end of the drop. Another thing that affects speed is the mass, if you were to have a cart with a mass of 40 and you go down the coaster the speed at the end would be 8.84. But if you were to go down the drop with a car mass of 60, you would have the exact same speed. Therefore the speed does not change if you change your mass. The Law of conservation of energy states that no energy is made or lost. So in our roller coaster, none of the energy is ever lost, it can just be made into other types of energy like sound or heat energy.\nDoes mass really affect KE and PE? Well, it does because mass is in the equation for KE and PE. therefore it affects how much energy both of them have. \n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "62", "Raw": "61", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 132", "Quality": " 0.4621", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6995", "Comprehensive": "0.5808", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 18(3), 19(3), 22(2), 23(2), 27(2), 29(2), 31(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 38(1), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 58(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 40 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

For example, when the initial drop height was only 2m, the PE at the top was only 1383J and when the initial drop height was 5m, the PE at the top was 2765J. Therefore the higher the drop height, the more speed. \n\n\nWhen the cart is going down the drop the PE transfers over to KE because the height is decreasing because it going down and the speed is increasing as well.\n\n\nThe law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. For example, when the initial PE was 1659J on a 3m initial drop, at the bottom of the drop the KE was 1658. The energy was not destroyed so instead some of the PE didn't fully transfer because it was still a little bit high even tho it was at the bottom of the drop. The same goes for when there is friction. Let's say the initial PE at the top of a drop was 5000J, and at the bottom the KE was 4200J and the PE was only two. The energy could not have been destroyed so this means that it was transferred over to thermal energy from friction. \n\n\nThe hill height should be not as high as the initial drop height because if the hill height is higher, there would not be enough KE to get over because it is taller than the initial drop height.

And when the initial drop height was 5 m and the mass of the cart was 60 g, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.88 m/s/s as well.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3185f4d8ff4cc29d0d", "class_id": "3", "teacher_id": "JN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "At the beginning of the roller coaster, the drop height needs to be 3.75m. The higher the drop height will allow for increased amounts of potential energy (stored energy). Potential energy will allow for more kinetic energy (energy an object has due to its motion) when it goes down the hill. From my first trial, I found that with an initial drop height of 2m, the car had 1,134 J of potential energy at the top and 1,134 J of kinetic energy at the bottom. When I increased the initial drop height to 5m, the car had 2,834 J of potential energy and 2,834 J of kinetic energy at the bottom. But, we also found that with an initial drop height of 5m, the car would have a speed of 9.88 m/s, which would be too fast for safety. Therefore, to allow for an exciting but safe roller coaster, 3.75m will be the best option for the drop height.\n\nWhile experimenting, we discovered that the greater the drop height, the faster the roller coaster will go. When we used a drop height of 3m, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 7.66 m/s. But, when we used a drop height of 4m, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.85 m/s. This helped us determine the drop height of 3.75m as we stated above to keep the roller coaster exciting and safe. \n\nSimilarly, we also experimented with how mass affects speed. It turns out, that the mass does not affect the speed at all in a frictionless environment. We found that when using a car with a mass of 40 kg, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.85 m/s. Additionally, when using a car with a mass of 60 kg, the speed at the bottom of the drop was still 8.85 m/s. Therefore, the mass will not affect the speed of the roller coaster.\n\nAnother thing to take into consideration is the mass of the car. I think that a car with a mass of 60 kg will be the best for this roller coaster. I found that a car with a greater amount of mass will result in a greater amount of potential energy at the top of the initial drop and a greater amount of kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop. In my first trial, a car of 40 kg resulted in 1,955 J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop, and 1,955 J of kinetic energy at the bottom. But, when I used a car with 60 kg it resulted in 2,932 J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop, and 2,932 J of kinetic energy at the bottom. The more mass we use, the more total energy there will be. That is how mass affects PE and KE.\n\nSince this roller coaster is used in a frictionless environment, the potential energy + kinetic energy will always equal the same thing. The only energy involved will be mechanical energy because there is no force of friction acting upon the objects. Due to this, as the roller coaster goes down the drop, all the potential energy will convert/transfer into kinetic energy. Similarly, as the car goes up the hill, the kinetic energy will convert/transfer back into potential energy. As such, the total energy will remain the same throughout. We know this because of the law of conservation of energy. That law tells us that energy can not be created nor destroyed.\n\nLastly, we need to take into consideration the hill height in regards to the initial drop height. Due to the frictionless environment, the hill height can be anything less than our initial drop height of 3.75m. As such, we decided that a hill height of 3m will be the best. As the car goes up the hill, the kinetic energy converts back into potential energy. Since our initial drop height was greater than 3m, it will have enough potential energy to get up the hill. In my first trial, I found that a hill height of 5m with an initial drop of 5m, would have 2,838 J of potential energy, but it would not be enough to get over the hill. But, with the same initial drop height of 5m and 2,838 J of potential energy, we would be able to get over a hill of 4.75m with 135 J of kinetic energy left over.

Also when I tested 5m the speed was too fast for the safety because it was 9.98 and the limit is 8.4m/s, but when I tested 3m the speed was 7.66 and that is below the safety amount and above the fun limit which is 6.7. When I did 5m though the speed was 9.98 m/s which is too fast. This means that the more height there is the more total energy there is and the more height there is the more speed there is. \n           I think the mass of the cart should be around 50 because the amount of mass doesn't affect the amount of speed but it does affect the amount of energy. Mass affects the amount of energy there is because it is in the individual equations so when you are calculating the potential energy the equation is PE=Mx9.8xH, and since Mass directly affects potential energy the amount of potential energy will increase. The same goes for kinetic energy because the equation for kinetic energy is KE=1/2xMxV^2 and since mass and kinetic energy are directly related the more mass there is the more kinetic energy there is.\n           In the simulation where there is no friction, the relationship between potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy was that the amount of total energy was the same as the amount of potential energy at the beginning and the total energy was the same as the kinetic energy at the end. This means that the amount of energy should stay the same in a frictionless environment. \n           Height affects the speed in a different way compared to mass because when you add more height to the initial drop there is more speed but when you add more mass nothing happens because mass doesn't affect speed. This is because height is in the equation for potential energy and not in kinetic energy but mass is in both equations so they cancel out.\n           When I was testing the initial drop for the rollercoaster I saw that cart started with 2775J of potential energy and 0J of kinetic energy, as the cart went down the drop it lost potential energy and the potential energy decreased and converted into kinetic energy so at the end of the drop the cart had 0J of potential energy and 2775J of kinetic energy. If I stopped the cart halfway through the drop the amount of potential energy and kinetic energy would be the same because as the cart goes down the drop it loses height causing the potential energy to decrease and convert into kinetic energy because it is gaining more velocity causing the kinetic energy to increase. This is because the law of conservation of energy states that energy can't be created or destroyed but it can convert into other types of energy and that is what is happening in the model. \n           This then leads me to the relationship between drop and hill height. When I was testing in the simulation I found out that the hill has to be shorter than the initial drop height. When I put the hill height at 2m and the initial drop at 5m the cart had no problem with getting over the hill but when I put the hill height at 5m and the initial drop at 5m the cart did not make it to the end of the ride. \n            Finally, when I tested different masses of the cart I noticed that the more mass there was the more PE there was at the start of the ride and more kinetic energy at the end of the ride. when I tested it I put the mass of the cart at 40kg and the amount of potential energy was 1957J and the start and 1957J of kinetic energy at the end but when I tested the cart at 60kg the amount of potential energy was 2936J at the start and 2936J of kinetic energy at the end of the ride. This then means that the amount of weight in the cart should be around 60kg because the more mass there is the more potential energy and the more kinetic energy there will be.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "52", "Raw": "74", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 122", "Quality": " 0.6066", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.8486", "Comprehensive": "0.7276", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 9(4), 10(3), 11(3), 13(3), 14(3), 16(3), 17(3), 19(3), 20(2), 27(2), 28(2), 29(2), 31(2), 33(2), 34(2), 36(1), 42(1), 47(1), 48(1), 49(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 52 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3185f4d8ff4cc29d12", "class_id": "3", "teacher_id": "JN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "The height of the drop relates to PE at the top because they have a direct relationship, the larger the height the bigger the PE. Also, KE and height have a direct relationship so when the car is at the bottom the KE will be bigger if the drop height is bigger. In my simulation when the drop height was 4 the PE was 2267 Joules and the KE was 2266, but when the drop height was 5 the PE was 2834 joules and the KE was 2833. \n\nThe relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is when the Car is at the top of the initial drop the PE is always the same as the total energy and the KE is always 0. When the car is at the bottom of the drop the KE is the amount of the total energy if there is no friction, but if there is some of the energy gets turned into nonusable energy and KE is less than the starting total energy. When the car is at the bottom the PE is always 0. The KE and PE are related on the top of the drop and bottom of the drop because if there is no friction they are the same.\n\nThe changes in PE and KE going down the drop is when the car starts accelerating it changes from PE to KE. The energy from PE doesn't get destroyed it gets converted into KE. That's why at the top of the drop the PE is the total energy and the KE is 0 and at the bottom of the drop the PE is 0 and the KE is the total energy or total energy that is usable. \n\nEnergy transformation happens when the PE converts to KE this is because The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. So when the car goes down the hill the energy changes from PE to KE.\n\nThe relationship between the drop height in hill height is that the initial drop has to be higher than the hill. In the simulation, I found that when I had both the initial drop and hill height at 5 the KE was only 29 joules at the top of the hill and it wasn't enough to make it over. But when the hill height was 4 and the drop height was 5 the KE was 559 at the top of the hill and was able to make it over. This shows the hill height must be less than the initial drop.\n\nThe relationship between mass PE and KE is when the Mass is more the total energy is more. In the simulation, I found that when the car mass was 50 the PE at the top of the hill ( total energy ) was only 2449 Joules and the KE at the bottom was 2444 joules. But when the mass was 60 the PE at the top of the hill was 2938 Joules and the KE at the bottom of the hill was 2895 joules. This shows that mass and energy have a direct relationship and when the mass goes up so do KE and PE. \n\nWe decided to change the initial drop and use 3.75 for our drop height because it went the fastest without going over the limit. For mass, it doesn't matter what we use because we found that with a mass of 42 kilograms the speed was the same (8.84 m/s) as it was with a mass of 58 kilograms.\n\nHeight and speed have a direct relationship because when one goes up so does the other. When the height was 5 the speed was 9.98 m/s and when the height was 3.25 the speed was 7.97 m/s. Mass does not affect the speed though because mass is not in the equation for speed. \n\nThe relationship between PE KE and total energy is when the car is at the top of the initial drop the PE is equal to the total energy. When the car goes down the hill the PE transfers into KE. At the bottom of the hill, the KE is the total energy and the PE is zero. But that is only if the track is frictionless. In the real world, some of the PE we had at the beginning will change to sound energy and heat energy or other nonusable energy. This means the KE at the bottom and total energy at the bottom will be less than the starting PE and total energy.\n\nThe law of conservation states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed that is why the energy is converted from PE to KE. This is what helps the object to move and stop. It affects my design because it helps it to slow down without this my roller coaster would go forever.\n\nMass and PE and KE all have a direct relationship. PE at the top and KE at the bottom have the same amount of energy unless there is friction.\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "58", "Raw": "50", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 128", "Quality": " 0.3906", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5734", "Comprehensive": "0.4820", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 7(4), 17(3), 19(3), 20(2), 24(2), 27(2), 33(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 39(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 37 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The PE at the beginning at 5 meters was 2443 Joules and the KE at the bottom of the roller coaster was 2443 Joules. This is going to create enough speed/velocity to get us over our hills, loops, and to the end of the roller coaster since it has the most energy. \n\nThe relationship between PE and KE is inversely related. When one of the energies goes up, the other goes down. For example: At the initial drop of 5 meters, the PE was 2443 Joules because of the height and mass but there were 0 Joules of KE because the car had no speed/velocity. When the roller coaster car started to go down the hill, the KE increased because it started to gain speed as the PE decreased because the roller coaster car was losing height. \n\nThe mass also affected the energy. For example: When the height was 5 meters and the mass of the car was 40 kg, the PE, KE, and total energy throughout the ride was 1957 Joules. But when the mass of the car was 60 kg, the PE, Ke, and total energy was 2936 Joules. This shows us that the relationship between Mass and PE, KE, and total energy are directly related. When one goes up, so does the other. \n\nThe relationship between the initial drop height and the hill height shows us that when the hill height is the same as the initial drop, the roller coaster car will not make it to the end of the ride. \n\nThe Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can go into different forms. In simpler terms, the total energy will always be the same.\n\nI choose a mass of 60 kg because the mass does not affect the speed of the roller coaster.\nThe height of the drop should be 3 meters and the hill height should be 2 meters because the height affects the speed because they are directly related meaning when one goes up, the other does too. \n\nThe mass is going to affect the PE, KE, and total energy because mass is a part of the equation. For example, when the mass of our car was 40 kg the PE, KE, and total energy were 1957 Joules. But when the mass of the car was 60 kg, the PE, KE, and total energy were 2936 Joules. When we increase the height the PE and total energy go up but not the KE. Height is a part of the PE and total energy formula but not the KE formula. For example, when the height was 3 meters, the PE was 2446 Joules and the KE was 0 Joules. But when the height was 5 meters, the PE was 2449 Joues and the KE was 0 Joules. This shows that one of PE's dependents is height but height is not a dependent for KE.\n\nWhen there was no friction, the PE at the top of the drop and the KE at the end of the ride was the same.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3185f4d8ff4cc29cfe", "class_id": "3", "teacher_id": "JN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "The first recommendation that I would make, to the Gonzales family, is that they should create a roller coaster with an initial drop height of 5 m. tall. I would make this recommendation for the roller coaster, because in the simulation when the initial drop height was set at 5 m, the PE at the top of the drop was 2834 J, and the KE at the bottom of the hill is 2833 J. Those are both higher amounts of energy, which will make the ride go faster, and ensure that the car makes it to the end. Whereas when the initial drop height was set at 2 m. tall, the PE at the top of the drop, was only 1134 J, and the KE at the bottom of the drop was only 1133 J. I think this energy data proves that if you want your cart to make it to the end of the roller coaster, you're going to need more energy, and a good way to make sure you have that energy is by creating the initial drop at a height of 5 m. tall.  Adding on to what I already said about the amounts of KE and PE, you might've noticed that they always equal each other. This is because the track is frictionless, so no energy is being transferred or changing forms into anything other than PE and KE. So for the initial drop, since there were 2834 J of PE at the top of it when it was 5 m. tall, and 0 J of KE at that height, the total energy would end up being the two of those added together, which equals 2834 J. As the cart heads down the drop, all that PE at the top of the drop will decrease, and the amount of KE will increase. This means that PE and KE, have an inverse relationship, since when one of those values increases, the other decreases, and vice versa. But, since the law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, the PE, does not just disappear, and the KE is not just created. The PE from the top of the drop transfers itself into KE, as it makes its way down the drop. Meaning no energy is created or destroyed, it has just changed forms. The amount of PE at the top of the track should be equal to the amount of KE at the bottom of the track, because of this. PE and KE always equal the total energy, and since there is 0 J of KE at the top of the track, and since there is no height at the bottom of the track, there should be 0 J of PE at the bottom of the track. However, in a real-life scenario, the track would have friction. This means that some of that PE, that transferred into KE in the frictionless track scenario, would transfer into thermal energy. It might seem like it is losing energy, but the friction of the track is really just causing it to change into a different form, then what you might see in the simulation with the frictionless track. \nThe second recommendation I would make is to make the hill height 3 m. I would make this recommendation because, based on the data that was collected, the hill height has to be smaller than the initial drop height. For example, when we put the hill height at 2 m. and the initial drop height at 5 m. the cart easily made it to the end, over the hill, and at the top of the hill, the amount of KE was 1743 J. However, when we kept the initial drop height at 5 m. and put the hill height at 5 m. also, the cart did not make it to the end or over the hill, and the KE at the top of the hill was only 1 J. This shows that the hill height should be shorter than the initial drop height, and I think that 3 m. would be a really good height for the hill, since it is shorter than the initial drop height of 5 m. and it has more PE at the top, causing for a more fun ride going down the hill. \nThe final recommendation that I would make is to put the mass of the car at 60 kg. I would recommend this because it causes there to be more energy. When the mass of the car was at 40 kg. The total energy was 1957 J, and that was also the PE at the top of the initial drop, and at the bottom of the drop, the KE was 1954 J. However, after changing the mass to 60 kg. The total energy increased a lot to 2936 J, which was also what the PE increased to at the top of the drop, and the KE at the bottom of the initial drop was 2911 J. So, the more mass the car has, the more PE the car will have, and as a result to that, it will also have more KE. Having more mass will increase both the PE and the KE, and having less mass, will decrease the PE and KE. \nThe height of the initial drop should be 4 m. tall. I think this because when the height of the initial drop was 4 m. tall, the speed was 8.84 m/s/s at the bottom of the drop. This means that it is too fast for safety, but I think in the real world, where there is friction, that would slow down, so it is likely to be under 8.4 m/s/s. Also, if it is 4 m. it will hopefully still be tall enough, that it will be able to make it over the loop and the hill. \nThe mass of the car should be 50 kg. In the simulation, since it is a frictionless environment, the mass does not affect the speed. For example, when the mass was 40 kg. the speed at the bottom of the drop and at the end of the ride was 9.88 m/s/s. However, when the mass was 60 kg. the speed at the bottom of the drop and at the end of the ride was 9.88 m/s/s. In a real-life scenario, there would be friction, though, so the more mass the cart would have the faster it would end up going. Since the only data I have is from the simulation, I would suggest 50 kg. because I think that, that would make the ride fun, but also help it to stay safe.

The higher your hill is the more PE you will have at the top and the more KE you will have at the bottom when the drop height is 2m the PE at the top is 1173J but when the drop height is 5m the PE at the top is 2932J, and with KE when the drop height is 2m the KE at the bottom is 1172J and when the drop is 5m the KE at the bottom is 2930J this just shows the relationship between the height of the hill and the PE at the top and the KE at the bottom. Another relationship is PE and KE and TE. The main thing about this relationship is that when you add the PE + KE you get TE, for example at the top of the drop that was 2m the PE was 1173J and the KE was 0 so 1173 + 0 = 1173J of TE and this also works at the bottom of the hill like the PE at the bottom of the hill was 1J and the KE at the bottom was 1172J so 1 + 1172 = 1173J of TE. Like the law of conservation of energy says energy can't be created or destroyed, but it can be transformed into a different form of energy so when you are at the top of the drop your PE is 1173J when you are falling you have about 568J of PE and KE because the PE was transformed into KE. This next relationship is my favorite it is the relationship between the drop height and the hill height it isn't my favorite because it's easy to understand it's my favorite because it was logical to it if you are testing a track formation and your initial drop height is 3 and your hill height is 5 you won't be able to make it over the hill because you won't have enough energy to make it over the hill but if your drop height is 5 and your hill height is 3 then you will be able to make it over the hill because you will have enough energy. The final relationship I'm going to talk about is the relationship between Mass PE and KE, This one is going to be pretty simple because it says only a couple of things, the more mass you have the more energy you will have so if you are sitting at the top of the drop and your mass is 40kg and your PE at the top of the drop is 1932J you will have less energy than if your mass was 60kg because the more mass you have the more energy you will have this goes for PE and KE.

The height of your initial height will relate to potential energy (which is stored energy that has not been released yet) and kinetic energy (which is energy an object has because of its motion.) The initial drop relates to potential energy because the higher your drop height is the more potential energy you will get out. For example, when I started off with an initial drop height of 2 meters the potential energy at the top was 1,173 joules vs when I did a drop height of 4 meters the potential energy at the top was 2,346 joules.  For all of my trial runs I had 0 joules of kinetic energy at the top. As the rollercoaster went down, the potential energy also went down and the kinetic energy went up. This is because potential and kinetic energy have an indirect relationship. The potential energy at the top equals the total energy and the kinetic energy at the bottom equals the total energy. When the car moves downhill, the kinetic energy is increasing. When the car moves uphill, the kinetic energy is decreasing. \n\nThe Law of Conservation of Energy states energy cannot be created or destroyed. For example, if I started off at the top of the rollercoaster with 100 joules of potential energy, halfway down the rollercoaster I would have 50 joules of potential energy and 50 joules of kinetic energy. When the rollercoaster would reach the end then, I would have 0 joules of potential energy and 100 joules of kinetic energy. No energy was being created or destroyed, the energy just transferred into a different form because energy transfers. This all affects my design decisions because I realized that energy is never going to be gone, its just going to transfer into potential energy or kinetic energy. \n\nThe hill height should be 2 meters. It should be smaller than the initial drop height because it won't produce as much energy as your initial drop but it will produce enough to make it fun. For example, when I did a hill height of 3 meters there was 2,931 joules of potential energy at the initial drop. When the car got to the top of the hill the potential energy was just 1,767 joules. And it made it to the end.  This data shows the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was doubled the amount of energy at the top of the hill. \n\nThe mass should be 30 kg. The more mass you have, the more energy you will have too. My car mass 40 kg and my total energy released was 1,957 joules of total energy. Then, I changed my car mass to 60 kg and my total energy released was 2,446 joules, but mass does not affect speed. So I could have any size car mass and still have the same speed. For example, I started off with a 40 kg car and the total speed at the end of the ride, was 9.88 m/s. Then, I did a 60 kg car and the total speed at the end of the ride was 9.88 m/s too. \n\n\n\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "46", "Raw": "58", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 116", "Quality": " 0.5000", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6651", "Comprehensive": "0.5826", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 2(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 9(4), 11(3), 15(3), 17(3), 20(2), 27(2), 31(2), 36(1), 37(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 59 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... but we also want the ride to be fun, safe, and enjoyable.\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 36 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... an object has because of its motion\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 2": "Content Unit: 4 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: .................... which is energy\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 3": "Content Unit: 20 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... which is stored energy and kinetic energy\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... because the higher your drop height is the more potential energy\n\t         .................... you will get out\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

When I put my initial drop height as 3.5 I found that the PE ( energy that is stored) was greater and it was 1711J. At the bottom, I saw that the KE( energy that is in motion) was almost the same as the Ke and the top. \n          \n            The amount of energy was keeping the roller coaster going. When I made the height 2m I saw that the Pe was only 1,134J. At the bottom, the KE was 1700. This drop height would be enough to go over more hills and go as fast. The relationship between PE and KE is direct. When the PE at the top of the hill is going down it is transferred into the Ke causing one to go up and the other to go down. The relationship between TE and PE and KE is always direct. When the PE at the top goes up the TE ( the total amount of the Pe and KE added together) also goes up. Same at the bottom the KE and the bottom goes up so does the TE. The changes in the PE and KE get transferred. For example When I set the hill height at 4m and the initial; drop at 5m. Pe at the top of the hill was not the same as it was at the bottom. The PE at the top of the initial drop was 2448J and the Pe at the top of the hill was 1922J. The energy gets transferred when the car is moving and not moving. \n        \n            The law of conservation states that energy can not be created or destroyed. During the MAss and energy experiment, I saw that when I put the car mass at 50kg I saw that the Pe at the initial drop was 2446J but the Ke and the bottom of the drop were 2430J. Those numbers should be the same so why weren't they? \n \n            The energy was transferred into sound energy, heat energy. Thi si called friction. The car mass should be 40kg. This can cause the roller coaster to have more energy and get over more hills because e the mass is lighter. \n             The relationship between the drop height and hill height is very different. When we put the initial drop at 5m and the hill height and five found that the cart didn't make it over. The total energy would make it go. This is why the Initial drop should be 3.5m and the first hill should be 3.26m. Because the car to go over and be able to have more energy in Ke to go over more hills. The relationship between mass, PE, and KE is different depending on the mass. When I out of the car mass at 50kg I saw that the PE was 2446 and the KE was 2430. The energy transfer. The relationship between these is inverse. One goes up the other goes up. PE and KE at the bottom are related because they show how the roller coaster isn't moving anymore. If the kinetic energy at the bottom is higher then the PE is going to be lower. This is because the roller coaster has no more potential or energy stored to get it moving again. It is at rest. The KE will have the majority of the energy. However, Heat energy and sound energy( all called friction) will also have some energy. \n         \n              Finally mass affects PE as well as KE. The more Mass a roller coaster has the more energy it will have scored at the top which is PE. For example in Mass and energy on trial, the car mass was 60kg and the PE at the top was 2,936J. In the trial of the car which had 40kg, the PE was 1957J. KE and mass have a direct relationship. At the bottom of the drop, the KE went up when the mass went up. In the same example as the car mass of 60kg, the KE was higher than the car mass of 40kg. \n             \n               The initial drop height should be 3.5 m. Then there should be a hill at the height of 3.36 m. This is just enough to allow the cart to go over. After that, the loop should be 2.5m Just enough to get the cart over and still be able to go fast. When I did this simulation the max speed was 8.27 m/s. The most the cart should go is 8.4 m/s. This is allowing the car to go fast without being harmful to passengers. \n         \n                  FInally mass doesn't affect the speed. When you plug in both the PE equation in the KE equation both of the masses cancel out. This is saying that the higher the mass doesn't affect the speed.

If you don't have enough initial PE the roller coaster won't make it to the end of the ride and at that point, the ride would be pointless. The greater the height is will depend on how much energy it will have and how much the cart will gain and lose along the ride. The higher the roller coaster is the more PE it will have and it will have a greater KE at the bottom of the hill, so the height can determine if the energy amount will be small or large. The PE and KE of this simulation switch depending on the height of the cart. Like if the cart is at the highest point of the roller coaster there is going to be a lot of PE and no KE, but as it reaches the bottom of the roller coaster or it comes to a stop then KE will be larger. In the tests we ran as the cart went down the hill the PE went down and the KE went up. The law of conservation of energy states that no energy is not being created or destroyed, as the cart goes down the hill but it is being used up and slowed by friction and that is what causes the cart to come to a stop if there isn't enough force and energy to continue the cart forward. \n       The hill height is going to have to be smaller than the initial drop height otherwise the cart will not make it over the hill because it will not have enough energy to get over the hill considering the PE at the top of the hill would be less and you can't expect smaller energy to be able to top bigger energy, especially depending on the cart's mass it might not even make it halfway up the hill. The mass of the cart will have a larger acceleration if it has a large drop height so the relationship between mass and height matters otherwise the roller coaster might not be operational. As you can see we have been doing some deep digging into finding out what will make a roller coaster fun and operational, and most importantly, safe.

This is proven when you look at the data we collected, for example, a 3-meter drop has an initial pe of 1759J and at the bottom, the kinetic energy was 1758J, and the speed was 7.66 m/s and for a 5 meter drop the potential energy at the top was 2932J and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2931J, the speed was 9.89 m/s. The reason that you want to maximize your potential energy is that the potential energy you have at the top in a frictionless environment is equal to the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop.\n       \n Another recommendation is the hill being below the height of the initial drop this is because when we had the hill height just below the initial drop height the kinetic energy at the top was 291J which is much less than when we had the hill at 2 meters which had a kinetic energy of 1765J at the top of the hill. This is because as you go down the hill you lose pe and gain kinetic energy but when you go up the hill you lose kinetic energy and gain pe this is because potential energy and kinetic energy are inversely related however they are both directly related to height and total energy for example when the height of the drop was 5m the potential energy at the top was 2932J and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2930J but when the hill height was 2m the potential energy was 1173J at the top of the drop and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1172J. Both kinetic energy and potential energy are related to total energy because when for the 2m drop when the total energy was 1173J the potential energy at the top was 1173J and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1172J but for the 5m drop the total energy was 2932 and the kinetic energy at the top was 2932J and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2930J. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy which states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed however it can be transferred from one type to another. \n\n        My last recommendation is that the roller coaster car has a mass of 60kg this is because if you want to maximize your pe and kinetic energy you need more mass because they are directly related. For example, a car with a mass of 40 kg has initial potential energy of 1957J and kinetic energy at the bottom of 1938J and for a 60kg car the initial pe is 2933J, and kinetic energy at the bottom is 2906J.

When I was testing the Initial drop I tried many heights. The height that gave the most potential energy and stayed under the speed limit was 3.5 meters. The taller the initial drop is the more PE there will be to make it to the end and the more KE there will be at the bottom. The KE will increase at the bottom because of the law of conservation of energy and the transferring of PE to KE. Since that law states no energy can be destroyed or made only transferred you see why the PE switched to KE. It happens as the cart goes down the tracks, so it's losing its potential to make a change in acceleration it has more kinetic energy. That is why the total energy will stay the same since the two types of energies are transferring nothing is being removed. The only way energy could be different is if there was friction since the PE and KE would be transferring into different energy. But, in our scenario that does not happen since there is no friction.\n\nI recommend the hill height should be 2 meters. When I tested a hill height of 2 meters it made it to the end as long as the initial drop height was more than 2 meters. That is why the drop height is 3.5 m. It's enough to get over anything coming up to it, plus an exciting ride for the passengers on it. At the top of the 2-meter hill, the cart had 1177 J of potential energy and 877 of kinetic. It had enough potential energy to keep going through anything approaching it. Like I said the 2-meter hill gave it a good amount of PE which then transformed into KE through the law of conservation of mass. Instead of having a 3-meter hill which would still make it to the end since there was enough energy, a 2-meter hill will make it and will a more enjoyable speed for a higher thrill experience while riding the rollercoaster. \n\nI recommend the mass of the car should be 60 kg. During my experiment at the top of the initial drop, having a car with 60 kg had a PE of 2936 J. Compared to the car mass of 40 kg which only had 1957 PE at the initial drop. With less PE there is a chance the car may not make it to the end of the ride depending on how the hills and loops are set up. So with 60 kg, we will have enough to finish especially with what I have set up for the hill and drop height. The more mass we have the more PE & KE there will be. That shows how PE, KE, and mass are all directly related. You may think if there are more kg of mass won't there be more speed, and will it go over the limit? No, it won't. Mass does not affect speed. No matter how much mass you have speed is not related to that.\n\nWith all these planned out heights and masses that leaves our speed is at a maximum of 8.3 m/s which is right below the limit. Since it is right below it will still be safe without being dangerous. It also makes the rollercoaster a very exciting ride because of its fast speeds.

For the next test, I did the height of 3m and my PE was up to 1466J this shows you that the higher you go the more energy you have for PE but what about KE well after the test was finished for my 2m high drop the KE was 976 and PE sill had 1J leftover from the drop and with the 3m drop it went up to 1465J and the PE still had 1J leftover that shows you that the energy just transfers over from the PE to the KE. This only makes sense if you know the law of conservation of energy it states that energy can not be created or destroyed so it transfers into other energy.\nyour total energy is the energy that you start and that is your PE since you have no transfer of energy you can lose or gain any energy. With PE means potential energy and potential means the development of something so that means that that is your energy at the top of the hill is stationary so the development is done it is just sitting there waiting to get released so when it does get released it transfers over to KE or Kinetic energy and that is the energy that is moving so when you are at the bottom of the hill you no longer have any potential energy. so when you add hills to your design you want your hill height to be smaller than the drop height because if it is bigger than the drop height will not have enough energy build-up to get over the hill.  when you have a mass of 40 on a 3m drop height the PE will be 1958 and the KE will be 1950J and with a mass of 60 and the drop height being 3m your PE will be 2933J and at the bottom, it will be 2924J so the bigger the mass the more energy you will have ", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "16", "Raw": "27", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 62", "Quality": " 0.4355", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3096", "Comprehensive": "0.3726", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 18(3), 26(2), 27(2), 32(2), 34(2), 42(1), 46(1), 47(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 26 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... height of the drop relates to PE at the top of the hill and KE at\n\t         .................... the bottom of the hill because.\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 18 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... when I got data for this essay I started my height at m and the PE\n\t         .................... at the top of my hill has J.\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The initial drop should be anywhere between 3.5-4 meters high. From my tests, anywhere above 4 was too fast, to where it is dangerous. We know that the higher the car is, the more PE there is, which will transfer over to KE. So we don't want the car so high it has too much PE to make into KE. In my data, I found that it struck a pretty good balance between safety and speed. \n\nPE + KE will always equal TE, no matter where the car is on the ride. Because the law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, that means that if the TE were to change, we would be creating or destroying energy. So whatever PE + KE is, is always equal to the TE. No matter where the car is on the ride.\n\nAt the start of the ride, according to my data. It was all PE and no KE, this is because the car is high, and has no velocity at the start of the ride. Meaning it has a lot of PE, but no KE. However, as the car moves down the drop, the energy transforms (meaning it changes from one kind to another,) from PE to KE, since the car is getting closer to the ground. So the energy transforms from all PE to mostly KE as the car moves down the roller coaster.\n\nThe drop height should always be taller than the hill height. Since the PE at the start of the ride is the TE we have for the whole ride. If you were to add a hill that was taller than the initial drop, the car wouldn't make it to the end of the track. Since it wouldn't have the energy. So the hill height must be shorter than the initial drop height.\n\nMass shouldn't effect the ride, so to save on materials, you could have a 40kg car. Because the mass didn't effect speed in any of my tests, it really doesn't matter that much in terms of the ride.\n\nPE at the top, in a friction less environment, will always equal KE at the bottom.

When my simulation had the drop height of 5m it gave me the most PE and KE out of my trials. If you were to compare my first trial to my last it would be 2m high with the PE of the initial drop being 977J and for my last trial, it would be 5m high with the PE at the top of the initial drop being 2443J. The higher the height of the drop the more PE there will be at the top and the more KE there will be at the bottom, so I recommend making the drop height high enough so it can release enough PE to make it to the end of the coaster. \n\nPE and KE relationship relies on the amount of energy that is given. If you have a 977J of PE at the top of the hill then that same amount of energy would transfer to the KE at the bottom of the hill. Energy cannot be created or destroyed but it can change, this has to do with the PE and KE because the amount of PE that you have when you go down a hill transfers over to the KE at the bottom so no energy is gained or lost as the car goes down the hill. The more mass a car has the more  PE and total energy it is going to have. \n\nWhen I compared the mass of a 40kg car the PE was 1958J at the top and at the bottom, the KE was 1954J, but when my car had a mass of 60kg the PE was 2987J at the top and the KE at the bottom was 2931J. So the more mass the car has the more potential energy it will start with and the more kinetic energy it will end with. The drop height should be more than the hill height because in order for the car to make it through all the loops and still make it to the end it will need the speed and energy from the higher drop. So for the Gonzales family to have the best roller coaster they need to include a high drop height in order to build up all that potential and kinetic energy so that the roller coaster makes it through the turns and to the end.\n\nI would make the height 5m because to me higher roller coasters are more fun, but it doesn't really affect the mass. The mass and height do not affect the speed of the coaster. When we made the mass of the car 40kg the speed at the end was 9.88, when we made the mass of the car 50kg it was also 9.88 at the end and it was the same as the 60kg one.\n\nThe height of the hill affects the PE and KE because the higher the hill the more PE it has and then that PE transfers into KE. The law of conservation of energy says that objects can not be created nor destroyed but they can change forms. This helps to show how hill height affects the PE and KE because the more speed your car has the more PE and that PE is transferred to the KE, so however much PE it had then that's the same amount that it transfers over to KE.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "36", "Raw": "46", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 106", "Quality": " 0.4340", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5275", "Comprehensive": "0.4807", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 11(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 24(2), 27(2), 29(2), 35(2), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... would be having the height of the drop be high.\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 27 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

I know this because when the initial drop height was 5 meters It had 9.88 meters per second of speed but when the drop height was 3 meters it was 7.65 meters per second of speed. But, since there is so much speed on the 5-meter initial drop height I recommend 3.5 meters so it is a safe but still fast and thrilling ride. \nWhen the cart goes down the hill the Potential energy (which is energy that comes from the height and mass.) will turn into Kinetic energy (which is motion energy and comes from velocity and mass.). Also, since there is no friction the Potential energy plus the Kinetic energy will always add up to the total energy. This is because energy cannot be created or destroyed and there is no friction so it can't turn into heat or sound energy. Since Potential energy is based on height, the farther down the cart is the less Potential energy it will have. And since Kinetic energy is based on velocity the farther down the cart is the more Kinetic energy it will have. So when the cart is going down the drop the Potential energy will turn into Kinetic and when it goes up the hill the Kinetic will turn into Potential energy. The spot where the most Potential energy is is at the start where it isn't moving and has the most height and the spot with the most kinetic energy is at the bottom where it has the most motion. \nI think the hill height should be 3.25 meters. This is because when I was testing out hill heights I had the initial drop at 5 meters and the cart didn't make it up a 5-meter hill but it did make it up a 4.75-meter hill. This means that if the hill is higher than or the same height as the initial drop then it won't make it up. That is why I put the hill height at 3.25 meters.\nI recommend that the mass of the car is 60 kg. I think this because when I tested it out the car that weighed 50kg only had 2452J of Potential Energy at the top and 2446J of Kinetic Energy at the bottom of the drop but when I tested out the car that weighed 60kg it had 2943J of Potential Energy at the top and 2935J of Kinetic Energy at the bottom. This means that the more mass there is the more PE and KE there is. I also learned that mass does not affect speed. When friction is zero the energy goes between PE and KE so you can put those equal to each other. When you cancel out mass and move speed to one side you see that there is no mass in the equation for speed.

This means that there was more KE at the bottom of the drop as well, causing it to make it further down the track. This was shown when we tested the drop height at 3 m and had 1466 J of PE at the top of the drop and 1465 J of KE at the bottom. Then, we increased the drop height to 3.5 m which caused the PE at the top of the drop to increase to 1710 J, and the KE at the bottom of the drop to be 1709 J. \n\nAnother reason I think the initial drop should be 3.5 m is that any height taller than that would cause the speed to be too dangerous. When we tested we kept the hill height the same throughout, 2 m. First, we tested a drop height of 3 m, which had a speed of 7.66 m/s at the bottom of the drop and at the end of the ride and it had a speed of 4.41 m/s at the top of the hill. However, we still had room to make it faster so we increased the drop height to 4 m which caused it to be too fast with a speed of 8.84 m/s at the bottom of the drop and at the end of the ride and a speed of 6.25 m/s at the top of the hill. So, we decided to test a drop height of 3.5 m which caused it to have a speed of 8.27 m/s at the bottom of the drop and the end of the ride and a speed of 5.40 m/s at the top of the hill. So we decided on this height because most of the ride wouldn't be at a boring speed but it wouldn't be to the point where it would be dangerous. \n\nNext, we should have a hill height anywhere under the drop height. This is because if the hill was higher than the drop height there wouldn't be enough KE to get the car to the top of the hill, resulting in a boring ride that gets stuck in the middle. When we tested hill heights we made the initial drop height 3.75 m. First, we tested a hill that was 2 m tall. The car easily made it over and had 959 J of PE at the top of the hill and 876 J of KE at the bottom of the hill, which would be enough to keep it moving. Then we tested a hill that was 3 m tall. Once again the car made it over, but this time it had more PE at the top of the hill, 1427 J, but there was less KE at the bottom, 408 J. Finally we tested a hill that was 5 m tall, but this time the car didn't make it over! We concluded that the hill was more successful when it had a lower height than the initial drop. Since our drop height is 3.5 we concluded that a 2 m hill would be the best option since the car would still be able to make it over but it wouldn't slow down a lot either. \n\nThroughout our experiments, we learned about the Law of Conservation of Energy, which says, \"energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred\". This tells us that our total amount of energy will ALWAYS stay the same. We could see this in our tests when at the top of the initial drop (3 m) there was 1466 J of PE and 0 J of KE, but at the end, there was only 1 J of PE and 1465 J of KE. The total amount of energy was 1466 J at the beginning and 1466 J at the end. \n\nBut where did the PE from the beginning go? What would happen if we stopped the car halfway down the hill?\n \nSince the total amount of energy always stays the same we know that the PE we had at the beginning had to go somewhere, and since the amount of KE went up we know that the PE transferred into the KE. Using this information we can infer that if we were to measure the amount of energy the car had halfway down the hill it would have equal amounts of KE and PE. Then, when it continued to move down the hill the PE would decrease and transfer into KE, making KE increase. (PE and KE have an inverse relationship, meaning when one goes up the other goes down) \n\nLastly, we should have a car with more mass since mass and energy have a direct relationship. This means when we increase the mass both KE and PE increase as well. We can see this when we had a car with a mass of 40 kg had 1957 J of PE at the beginning, and 1950 J of KE at the bottom. Then when we increased the mass to 50 kg the PE increased to 2446 J of PE at the beginning and 2437 J of KE at the bottom. Since we want more energy to make sure the car stays in motion throughout the entire ride so it would be better to have a car with more mass. However, mass does NOT affect speed. This is because in a world without friction the PE at the top is equal to the KE at the bottom. This means that the equations can be written like this: mgh=1/2mv^2. As we can see, mass is on both sides of the equal sign, this means it cancels each other out, then we can rewrite the equation to solve for v (velocity, which is speed and direction). So, when you solve for velocity the new equation looks like this: v=â(2 x gravity x height). As you can see, mass is not in the equation, therefore it doesn't impact the velocity. Mass does, however, impact the amount of energy which is important to keep the ride moving, and air resistance will not impact it as much as it would impact a car with less mass, causing the car to not slow down (as much) because of air resistance. So, I propose that we use a car with more mass (50-60 kg). \n\nThese were just a few ways to help improve your roller coaster to be more fun, exciting, and safe. \n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "76", "Raw": "47", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.3534", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5390", "Comprehensive": "0.4462", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 10(3), 14(3), 17(3), 18(3), 20(2), 23(2), 25(2), 27(2), 29(2), 32(2), 35(2), 37(1), 38(1), 42(1), 46(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 35 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

Potential energy is the energy an object has stored, but then as the the object will go down the hill that energy will transfer into Kinetic energy, which is the energy that an object has when its in motion. At the top of the first drop though the kinetic energy would be 0 Joules. According to the law of conservation of energy, energy can never be created or destroyed. So when the car would start moving down the hill the potential energy would transfer into kinetic energy. \n        In my data, when the initial drop height was at 5 meters, the amount of potential energy it had was 2443 Joules, which was the highest amount of potential energy I had out of all of the other trials. Since we know that  potential energy will end up being transferred to kinetic energy as the car goes down the drop, that means that the more potential energy we have the more kinetic energy we will have. So even though potential and kinetic are inversely related  that total energy between the two will always stay the same as the initial amount of energy the car had at the top of the first drop. \n        Something I have also discovered through my data is that I think the hill height should be smaller that the initial drop height. According to my data, the hills that were larger that the initial drop prevented the car from getting over the hill, as for the hills that were smaller than the initial drop height allowed the car to get over because the car had enough energy. I have also decided that I think the mass of the car should be 60 kg because data has shown that the height and mass will make the acceleration due to gravity larger. From the difference between 50 and 60 kg, there was a large increase of joules in potential energy. \n        After further research, I am changing my decision on the height of the initial drop due to safety reasons with speed, so the new initial drop height will be 3.5 meters. But now since the height is smaller, the potential energy will end up decreasing, so I still think that the mass of the car should be 60 kg because mass and energy are directly related. In my data, adding mass increased potential energy. \n        Height affects the total energy in a friction less world where PE at the top of the drop is equal to KE at the bottom of the drop. And the amount of PE there is at the top of the initial drop is the total energy there will be throughout the ride. Since height affects the PE at the top of the drop, that connects to the total energy being larger due to a higher drop. The amount of mass also has this affect on the potential energy because in my data, the larger mass is, the larger potential energy there will be. And again in a friction less world the pe at the top is equal to the ke at the bottom, showing that the total amount of energy won't change. \n        Mass has no affect on speed. My data showed that when I kept the initial drop and hill heights the same through all the trials but I manipulated the mass, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 7.66 m/s. And the speed that the top of the hill was 4.41 m/s. As I changed the mass from 40 kg to 50 to 60, the speeds at the bottom of the drop and top of the hill never changed. \n        Height however does have an affect on speed. My data shows that an increase in height will lead to a increase in speed. This is because speed comes from the amount of potential energy, if I were to have very little pe, the car would have very little speed. But if I were to have a lot of pe by increasing a drop height, then there would be a lot more speed. \n        The law of conservation of mass affects my design because the law states energy can never be created or destroyed. In the fiction less world all of the energy would stay will the roller coaster and the energy would just continuously switch back and forth from pe to ke and the ride would never end on its own accord, so the total energy at the beginning and end of the ride will stay the same. But of the design involves friction than the ride will slowly come to a stop on its own and the total energy at the beginning and end of the ride will be different. This isn't because the energy was destroyed, it's just because it was transferred to other kinds of energy like sound or heat energy.\n\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "58", "Raw": "68", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 128", "Quality": " 0.5312", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7798", "Comprehensive": "0.6555", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 8(4), 11(3), 12(3), 15(3), 17(3), 19(3), 20(2), 27(2), 29(2), 31(2), 32(2), 34(2), 42(1), 47(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 51 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... , this is because the more height something has, the more\n\t         .................... potential energy it has.\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 4 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: .................... that energy will transfer into Kinetic energy, which is the energy\n\t         .................... that an object has when\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 8 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: ....................

The data shows that the higher you go the more PE the car has which is more speed as well this allows the roller coaster to be able to do hills and loops because all of that energy can't be destroyed and so it all goes to KE and so that allows for loops and hills to happen.   Like there might be 100 PE and 0 KE on top of the hill and when you get to the bottom of the hill it goes to 0 PE and 100 KE because it's stated that energy can't be energy added or destroyed.  Now for TE (total energy), It does not change from what KE+PE equals because the energy just gets swapped from PE to KE still equaling the same TE.  When the car travels down the starting drop or really any drop it starts to go down so the second it drops it goes done and done until it's at the bottom and you have taken that energy and made it KE.  Kinda like if I was to have a glass of water and slowly pour it into another glass transferring the water.  Another reason to have the beginning drop height the highest as possible is it gives use the most speed and so now when we add a hill or a loop we go at it with the TE of the drop and when we go up the hill we lose some KE and it turns Into PE as long as we make the hill not as big as beginning drop we will be able to get up that hill and then go down now that KE that went into PE going up goes back into the KE because TE always stays the same.

We know that there is more potential energy at the top because, in our first simulation, the PE at the start of the initial drop at 2m was 977J, but the PE at the start of the 5m initial drop was 2443J which is a lot more than 977. The more PE we have at the top also affects the amount of kinetic energy throughout the ride. If there is more KE throughout the ride, then the coaster can go faster and be more fun. Our hill height won't be too tall though because then it will be unsafe to ride because of how fast it would be going. The height we will have as the initial drop is 3.5 meters.\n\nHeight affects PE because the formula for PE is PE=mass*gravitational pull*height so when height goes up, PE goes up.\n\nThe reason that PE affects KE is that all of the PE  is transferred into KE as the coaster goes down the initial drop, and the higher up the object the more PE there is to turn into KE. The opposite happens when the coaster is going up a hill. So, when an object is at the top of the drop, all of the energy is PE, and when the object is at the bottom of the drop, it is all KE.\n\nIf there is no friction, the total amount of energy equals PE plus KE. If there is friction, you also have to add a bunch of the other types of energy in as well. \n\nThe most PE the coaster has is at the top of the initial drop, but as the coaster goes down the hill, the PE switches to KE. At the bottom of the hill when all of the energy is KE, the amount of KE equals the amount of PE at the top of the drop if there is no friction. This is because of the law of conservation of energy which states that energy can not be created nor destroyed, only transferred. Because of this, a coaster cannot make it over a hill taller than the drop height because there will not be enough KE to get over the hill because the PE at the top of the drop is smaller than the amount of PE at the top of the hill, so the coaster cannot just pull energy from the air to get over the hill. \n\nThe mass of the coaster car does not matter when there is no friction because no matter the mass, the speed is always the same, this is because when you are solving for velocity (speed) so it has no effect on speed.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3185f4d8ff4cc29d21", "class_id": "4", "teacher_id": "JN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "I recommend that the Gonzales family uses a high drop point than the hill height. This is because of the fact that the higher the drop point the more potential energy joules there are and when at the bottom of the track the more kinetic energy joules there are. For example, in trial 1 for the initial drop, I had the release height at 5 meters. The potential energy was 2443 joules and when the cart went down the track the kinetic energy was 2442 joules. And for trial 2 I had the drop height at 4 meters and the potential energy was 1955 joules and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1954 joules. From those 2 trials, we now know that the relationship between the height and PE and KE is a direct relationship, and when the height is high then PE and KE are going to also will have a high amount of joules. \n\nThe relationship between PE and KE (or potential energy and kinetic energy is) an inverse relationship and the relationship between PE and KE and TE is a direct relationship. for example in initial drop trial 1 at the very top of the coaster at the drop point the PE was 2443 joules and when the cart went down the coaster at the bottom the KE was at 2442 joules at PE was at 1 and TE was 2443. And in trial 3 at the drop point, the PE was 1466 joules and when the car went to the bottom the KE was at 1465 joules and the PE was at 1 and 1466. From those trials, you were able to see that both KE and PE are directly related to TE because even when PE and KE have their energy move from one to the other the TE always stays the same because the total energy will never change. PE and KE are both mechanical types of energy which means that the energy can transfer from one to the other as you can see above so that is why they have an inverse relationship. Also if this was in the real world the kinetic energy would be less because of friction and the transformation of non-mechanical energy which is where that energy would go if there is friction which is exactly why the law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed.\n\n The relationship between the drop height and hill height is that the drop height needs to be larger than the hill height because there is not enough total energy that can be transferred into kinetic energy. The relationship between mass and PE and KE is that when there is more mass there is more PE and less KE. For example, In trial 1 of mass and energy, the mass was 60kg and when the cart went down the hill there were 6 PE joules and 2930 KE joules with the total energy being 2936. For trial 2 when the cart went down the track there were 5 PE joules and 2696 KE joules with the total energy being 2701. and as you can see that for every 5 kg there is 1 PE more when the car is at the bottom of the track. \n\nFor your initial height should be more than the hill height so you have enough energy to clear the hill. In trial 1 the initial height was 5 meters and when the cart went down the drop at the bottom the speed was 9.88 m/s, at the top of the hill it was 7.65, and at the end of the ride was 9.88 m/s. For trial 2 the height was 4 meters and when the cart went down the hill at the bottom the speed was 8.84 m/s, at the top of the hill was 6.24 m/s, and at the end of the ride was 8.84 m/s. In the end we now know that the relationship between the speed of the cart and the initial drop is a direct relationship because when there is a higher drop height the speed will be faster and the same thing for hill height and speed will be a direct relationship.\n\nMass and speed/velocity have no effect on each other. The equation for velocity is mxgxh=1/2mv squared and  if you solve for velocity you will subtract mass from one side and subtract to the other and since the mass of the object will always stay the same there will be no mass even corolated in the equation for velocity. And in the end the equation for velocity is the square root of gxh=v.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "53", "Raw": "58", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 123", "Quality": " 0.4715", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6651", "Comprehensive": "0.5683", "Content Unit": "3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 10(3), 11(3), 14(3), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 20(2), 21(2), 24(2), 27(2), 32(2), 33(2), 34(2), 37(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "6278bd4c14d3319042ba6927", "class_id": "1", "teacher_id": "JP", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "Essay 1:\nThe best possible roller coaster needs a tall initial drop, hills that gradually decrease in size, and a cart mass that allows PE and KE to thrive.\n\nA tall initial drop can help with having a fun and successful roller coaster because the higher the initial drop height is, the more total energy the cart will have. In trial two of my initial drop experiment, when the initial drop is 5 m tall (the highest possible height), the total energy the cart carries peaked with 2545 joules. However, when the drop height was 4.53 m (the lowest height I tested), the total energy only got to 2217 joules. The higher the initial drop is, the more PE it will have at the top and KE it will have at the bottom.\n\nThe more potential energy you have at the top of a hill or drop, the more kinetic energy you will have at the bottom of it, the more kinetic energy you have at the bottom of a hill, the more PE you will have at the top of the next one. For example, in my \"Add a hill\" experiment during my first trial, the PE at the top of my initial drop was 2555 J, which led to the KE at the bottom peaking at 586 J, my best result.\n\nIf an added hill is taller than or the same height as your initial drop, the car's energy will not be enough to make it over. Hills must gradually get smaller in order to have a successful ride. During my \"Add a hill\" experiment, you can see that in my fourth trial the hills height was 4.51 m. This was my second tallest one, and it was only shorter than the initial drop by .09 m, but the car still made it over. However, in my second trial when I put the hill height as 5 m (the same as my initial drop) and it did not have enough energy to make it over.\n\nHow tall the hill is isn't the only thing that affects the PE and KE of an object though, the mass of the object will also greatly effect the energy within an object. Objects with greater masses will have more potential and kinetic energy. You can see this by comparing my second and third trial in my \"Mass & energy\" experiment. In my second trial I set the car mass to 60 kg, making the total energy of the car 2913 J, my best score. However, in my third trial I had the car mass be 40 kg, this lead to the total energy of the car performing the worst out of all my trials with 1942 J.\n\nEssay 2:\nSpeed is an important factor to making a safe, enjoyable ride too. But how fast is too fast? Speed recommendations for a roller coaster is anywhere from 6.7 m/s - 8.4 m/s. Both drop height and mass can be a determining factor for the speed of the ride.\n\nDuring my \"Drop height & speed\" experiment, I experimented with which drop height would have an outcome of the fastest ride while keeping the speed under 8.4 m/s. In my sixth trial I set the drop height to 3.41 m, resulting in the speed at the bottom of the drop being 8.16 m/s, the speed at the top of the hill being 2.82 m/s, and the speed at the end of the ride going back to 8.16 m/s. \n\nIn my \"Mass & speed\" experiment, I had to figure out whether or not mass affected speed in a friction less world. I came to the conclusion that the mass of the car (without friction) did not matter in terms of speed because whatever mass I set the car to, the outcomes in terms of speed were the same. For example, in my third trial the mass of the car was 60 kg and the speed it had was 8.16 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop, 2.83 m/s at the top of the hill, and 8.16 m/s at the end of the ride. During my fourth trial I set the car mass to 45 kg, the results were the exact same.\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "50", "Raw": "42", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 120", "Quality": " 0.3500", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4817", "Comprehensive": "0.4158", "Content Unit": "3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 10(3), 11(3), 17(3), 20(2), 21(2), 27(2), 28(2), 32(2), 35(2), 40(1), 42(1), 46(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 10 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: ....................

I would choose a drop height of 3.5 meters because it was the highest you could go, without going over the speed limit of 8.4 m/s. It did not have the highest PE, compared to the other heights we experimented with. The PE at the top was 1710 Jules, but If you dropped from a height of 4 meters, the PE at the top would be 1956 Jules, but would travel at 8.83 m/s. Which would be over the safety limit. As you can see, the higher the initial drop, the faster the cart will go. We would choose a hill height of 3 meters because you can maintain a lot of speed, and being able to make it over the hill. You maintain some speed because there is still some KE left over at the top of the hill. In my data, if you have an initial drop of 3.5 meters and a hill height of 3, then there will be 1423 Jules of PE, and 287 Jules of KE at the top of the hill. If you had a hill higher than that, then the cart might not make it over. The cart that had a hill of 4.5 meters did not make it over, because it ran out of PE. PE and KE make up the total energy. PE changes into KE when the cart starts going down the drop. when the cart starts climbing the hill, the KE starts to drop, and the PE rises again. But you can never lose energy, because of something called the Law of Conservation of energy. This \"law\" states that you can never gain, or lose energy, but energy can change into other forms of energy (PE to KE, or KE to PE). \nI chose a 60 kg car, but you can use any weight for the cart, because Mass does not affect the velocity.

That means making the initial drop height taller. Not only that, but you need to have a heavy car, too. The greater the mass, the greater the potential energy (PE). When you make the drop height taller, that adds on to the PE. When the car goes down the drop, the PE is transformed into kinetic energy (KE). The more PE there is, the more KE there will be. The Law of Conservation says that energy can't be destroyed or created. That's why the KE cannot exceed the original PE. When adding a hill, you can't make it taller or the same height as the initial drop. The car will not have enough energy to go over it. If you make the hill smaller, the car will have enough energy to go over it. In the data tables, you can see that when the initial drop is 5 m, the PE at the top is 2932 J. When the initial drop was only 2 m, the PE at the top was 1173 J. When I added a 5 m hill with the 5 m initial drop, the car wouldn't go over. But when I added the 4.55 m hill, the car went over.

Just as long as the loops and twist don't require more PE then the Roller coaster has or KE. The amount of speed the car will have because of this drop will be very fast this is good because the more speed there is the more velocity there will be. Mass of the car wonÂ´t effect the car because the roller coaster is in a friction less world, this is important because if there is no friction then the mass of the car has no effect because friction is needed to have thermal energy and without friction the mass of the car wonÂ´t slow down the speed of the car. The design of the roller coaster is 3.5 meters tall this is so that the roller coaster is in the safety speed. The mass of the car would be 60kg this is so the car has more PE. The reason this won Â´ t affect the speed is because the mass of the car doesnÂ´t have an effect on velocity in a friction less world. This is shown with a car that has 60 kg of Mass has a speed of 8.27 off of an initial drop of 4 meters. If the drop stays the same and has a drop of 4 meters and a mass of 40 kg, without friction the speed of the car stays 8.27 at the bottom of the drop. The height of the roller coaster is 3.5 because In the data it was found that it was the closest I found to the max speed limit of the roller coaster. I went for a higher roller coaster drop because the higher the drop of a car is how much PE there will be the Mass also has a affect on the amount of PE there will be, which is why I choose the max amount of Mass. The mass has no effect on speed so Its more PE with little concern. The more PE there will be the more hills and loops there can be. The mass of the cart can be shown to have a effect on PE, If the Mass of a car was 60 kg on a Initial drop that was 4 meter tall the amount of PE there will be at the top of the hill is 1468, this is significantly more PE on the same hill but with a car that has 40 kg of mass the PE at the top of that hill is 978 PE which is much less then the car with 60 kg of mass on the same hill. The Law of Conservation of Energy affects my design because the amount of PE in the Initial drop is important because at the bottom of that drop the amount of PE my cart would have would be 0 but the KE would be the same as the amount of PE I initially had, because the PE was transferred into KE. The reason Law of Conservation of Energy has an effect on my deign is because this allows the car with 60 kg of mass to have the same amount of speed as the car with 40 kg Is because the Mass Has no effect on the Law of Conservation of Energy equation.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "40", "Raw": "34", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 110", "Quality": " 0.3091", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3899", "Comprehensive": "0.3495", "Content Unit": "3(5), 6(4), 16(3), 19(3), 22(2), 23(2), 32(2), 35(2), 37(1), 38(1), 39(1), 42(1), 44(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... which would allow it to have a very high initial drop allowing it\n\t         .................... to have more PE\n\t", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 4": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... because are roller coaster\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 39 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... as the loops and twist do nt require more PE then\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 37 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... the car will have because of this drop\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 32 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

We are looking for the most potential energy, kinetic energy and total energy we are able to have on this roller coaster if we want to make it to the end of the ride. \n\nIf we were to set the initial drop height to 2 meters then the potential energy at the top would only be 973 J and the kinetic energy at the bottom would only be 973 J. The height of the drop makes the potential energy at the top higher the higher the drop is, and the higher kinetic energy the higher the hill is. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be destroyed or created but simply moves from one energy type to another. So this means that potential energy affects kinetic energy because, at the top of a hill all of the total energy will all be potential energy. In the middle of the drop it will be half potential energy and half potential energy. And at the bottom of the hill all of the total energy will be in kinetic energy. But if we set the initial drop height to 5 meters then the amount of total energy will be 2434 J. However we must think about speed to get the final initial drop height.\n\nIf we set the hill height to 2 meters the car would be able to make it over but only have total energy of 2443 J. But if we set the hill to 5 meters the car would not make it over the hill. So since we need enough energy to make it over the hill, we will need to have the hill height slightly less than the initial drop. \n\nIf we set our car mass to be 40 kg we would only have a total energy of 1956 J. But if we set our mass of the car to be 60 kg this will get us a total of 2934 J, helping us get a big enough drop and a big enough hill to help us make it to the end of the ride with the most total energy. Mass affects potential energy and kinetic energy by the amount of mass a car has can affect the total energy which in turn affects the potential energy and kinetic energy of the ride, meaning more mass equals more energy. \n\n\nOur speed needs to reach 6.8 m/s if we want the people to have fun, but the speed cannot go over 8.4 m/s because then it would be unsafe. So if we set our initial drop height to be 5 meters then the speed at the bottom of the drop would be 9.89 m/s being a bit over our requirements. So then if we set the initial drop height to 4.25 meters the speed at the bottom of the initial drop would be 9.11 m/s, still being over the required safety measures. So if we set our drop height to 3.5 meters our speed at the bottom of the drop would be 8.27 m/s making the ride safe and fun because the higher the initial drop is the more speed and energy you can get.\n\nIf we set our mass to be 40 kg then the speed at the bottom of the drop would be 8.26 m/s. But if we set our mass to be 60 kg the speed at the bottom of the drop would barely change and be 8.27 m/s.

So we have to include some of these elements, such as a high enough initial drop, a hill that is shorter than the initial drop, and a good mass to ensure that the cart goes over the track. The drop height can affect the amount of energy that is used upon the ride, which potential energy starts at a resting state. So as you move down the slope the potential energy starts to turn into kinetic energy that comes within a moving state. We need a high enough drop height to get enough energy to get to the end of the coaster. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, so start off with a good base. We also have to watch out and make it a safe speed for riders, the most enjoyable speeds are from 6.7 - 8.4 m/s. To get enough of that potential energy and stay at an enjoyable speed the initial drop needs to be high enough. In my learning so far I have learned that the best initial drop is 3.49 m because it gave us a total speed of 8.26 M/s which is fun and still safe for riders and it gave us 1718 J of potential energy that we can work with. But the drop of 2.75 m only gave us 1343 J of energy down the slope and was so slow that it wouldn't give riders that same rush feeling.  Now that we have the initial drop figured out, it is time to add a hill, also based on my data. The best hill that will ensure the most enjoyment is the hill height of 2.5 m because we can still make it past with enough energy left. The last part which is pretty important, is the mass of the cart. We need to have enough of a mass to also add more energy to the coaster to start off with more potential energy and add more total energy to get to the end of the track. The best cart mass is about 60 kg, because this will give you more energy to work with down the 3.49 m slope, Yet this will not actually change your speed because of this equation: Mass x gravity x height = 1/2 mass x velocity2. The masses both cancel each other out in a controlled system so this will actually still keep the riders safe. So the most enjoyable ride would be with an initial drop of 3.49 m, a hill with 2.5 m and a cart mass of 60 kg.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "6278bd4c14d3319042ba6938", "class_id": "1", "teacher_id": "JP", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "To insure the best roller coaster you need, the best inital drop height, hill height, and mass of the roller coaster car.\n\nThe first part of making the best roller coaster is the inital drop height. The drop height needs to be as high as you can make it, the higher the drop the more total energy the more PE at the top, KE at the bottom, so the faster the coaster will go also the PE at the top determines the total energy, so you can base the amount of energy on the PE at the top since there is no kinetic energy at the top of the hill since you haven't moved yet, and the law of conservation of energy states that energy can't be created or destroyed so it the PE at the top os the total, it will not change. I found, for a 5m inital drop the PE at the top was 2932J and the KE at the bottom of the drop was 2930J and 2932J of total energy, while the 2m inital drop had only 1173J of PE at the top of the drop, and 1172J of KE at the bottom of the drop and 1173J of total energy. This means the higher the drop the more PE at the top, resulting in more speed and KE at the bottom. \n\nThe next part of creating the best roller coaster is having the most efficent hill height. With a 5m inital drop, the hill height can not be the same, or exceed the inital drop, to allow the car to get over the hill since the amount of PE in a drop height is not enough to get over a hill, and will not allow enough KE to get over a hill the same or higher height. The smallest drop does not result in the most energy, the middle height of the hill (3) results in the most energy. In my tests, I found the 5m hill result in the most total energy, 2449J, but the car can not get over the hill. The 2m hill height allows the car to get over the hill, but only produces 2445J of total energy, as well as the 4.3 hill which allows the car over the hill, but does not produce the most total energy, only 1445J as well. The hill height that was most effective was the 3m hill, which produced 2446J of total energy, allowed the car to get over the hill, and with the most PE at the top of the hill it would be fast as well. \n\nThe final part of creating the best roller coaster is making the car mass that has the most total energy. The car with the most mass will create the most PE energy at the top of the drop, and the most KE at the bottom of the drop. The 60kg car resulted in 2936J of PE at the top of the drop, and 2929J of KE at the bottom of the drop, and the 40kg car only resluted in 1958J of PE at the top, and 1953J at the bottom of the drop. And since PE, determines the total energy or the other way around, the total energy and PE help to find the best design since they explain all of the energy, so determine the most energy. This means the higher mass means the more total energy, and the more speed the car results in. \n\nIn conclusion the highest inital drop, the medium drop height (relating to the drop), and the highest car mass will result in the best roller coaster. The highest total energy results in the faster ride, which is determined at the top of the hill since energy can not be created or destroyed. \n\n\n\nFor the best, and safest ride you need the best drop height, and mass of the roller coaster car. \n\nThe drop height needs to be as high as possible, however it cannot generate more than 8.4m/s the entire ride, and at least one point has to reach 6.7m/s. The higher the inital drop, the more speed you have. For the highest drop, 5m it had the most speed, however it had 9.88m/s of total energy and that exceeds 8.4 so it would not be a safe ride. If my best hill height was 3m, my drop height could not be any lower since the car had to make it over the hill. So the best and safest inital drop was 3.6m since it had the most energy, 8.39m/s, without exceeding the 8.4m/s so still being safe for the riders. \n\nThe mass of the car to be the fastest car, does not matter. I learned from my trials that every mass of the car resulted in the same amount of speed every time. The 40kg car had 8.39m/s at the bottom of the drop, 3.41m/s at the top of the hill, and 8.38m/s at the end of the ride, the 60kg car had the exact same, 8.39m/s at the bottom of the drop, 3.41m/s at the top of the hill, and 8.38m/s at the end of the ride. This is because without friction the mass doesn't affect anything since the mass cancels it's self out in the equation, and how fast you go is not affected by how heavy the car is. Velocity(speed and direction) is determined by gravity and height, not mass. However mass does determines the amount of PE, KE, and total energy. \n\nMy final design decsion is 3.6m inital drop, 3m hill height, and 60kg car mass.

The smallest height was 2.25 meters and the total amount of energy was only 1231 which means you couldn't do too many fun things with the coaster you would like to build. \nThe energy can never be taken away nor made, the PE matter because it is deciding how fast the coaster might go down the hill and PE has all of the original energy. KE is the bottom, or like the coaster moving it moves the coaster and the PE and KE work in perfect harmony passing the energy back n forth between the hills but of course, we need the coaster to eventually stop. The mass of the cart is very important though because the more mass the more energy there will be overall. KE and PE are important because it makes the object have a type of force helping it to move. PE is saving energy its called conservation of energy then the energy gets passed to KE helping the object go on hills and or loops.\n My team suggests a high initial drop like 3.75 meters then you could do many loops and hills but everything after the initial height must be smaller than it and every hill or loop will need to be shorter than the one before because it can only have so much energy. -------------------------------------I have learned that the mass of the cart doesn't really matter in the overall run without friction because no matter the weight the cart is going to have nothing to stop it from going. If you do the equation for mass the masses cancel each other out before they get a chance to change anything about the ride. We haven't learned too much about friction but friction will affect the overall moving of the cart depending on the mass. The cart also can be too fast because it can lead to lawsuits so we shouldnt try to make it as fast as we can. The best I have found was the initial drop height being 3.55 because the overall speed would be 8.33 whcih is right bellow the lawsuit line.

Our very best design so far includes a 5.00-meter initial drop with a 2.86-meter hill. After our experiments, we found the 5-meter drop had the most energy with 2932 J while the 3 m only had 1759 J. This is why we decided to use the 5 meters instead of the 3 meters for our initial drop. The 5 m had 2932 J of PE at the top, PE is the amount of energy something has when not moving. After multiple tests, we decided that the mass of the car would be 60kg which allows the roller coaster to have more energy to make it to the end compared to a 40kg cart which only has 1957 KE at the bottom of the drop which would not be enough energy to make it over the hill. The 60 kg cart has 2935 KE, KE is the amount of energy something has while it's moving, at the bottom of the drop which is enough to make it over the hill. Speaking of the hill, the hill height would be 2.86 m because if the hill height is shorter than the initial drop then the cart would be able to go over it and make it to the end. We chose 2.86 m because it has 2935 J instead of 2 m because that one has 2932 J. This allows the cart to have more energy as it moves so the PE will convert into KE because of the law of conservation of energy which means energy can not be created or destroyed in a closed system. So the more energy the coaster has the faster and more exciting the ride will be but also will make it so the cart will be able to finish. The more total energy the more PE and KE which makes the coaster have more energy so the ride can make it to the end and be able to get over the hill with enough energy.  In conclusion, we think it would be most effective for the rollercoaster to have a 5-meter initial drop and a 2.86-meter hill height the weight of the cart should be 60-kg. This way the ride will be fun and exciting but still have enough energy so the car won't have to stop and will be able to get over the hill.\n\nThe height of the initial drop needs to be tall enough to be fun but short enough to be safe, so the drop height should not be 5 meters tall, the speed for a 5-meter tall drop would be 9.89 m/s at the bottom of the drop, this is way too fast and is incredibly unsafe. A good height would be 3.60 m/s because the speed at the bottom of the initial drop would be 8.38 which is in range of the set requirements of speed. If the drop height was this high then the ride would be fun and safe. The mass of the car does not affect KE or PE in a frictionless environment., in trial 1 when the mass of the car was 60kg the speed was 8.39 m/s but in trial 4 when the car was 40 kg the speed was still 8.39 m/s, this happens because mass does not affect the speed of the ride. In every trial no matter the weight the speed stayed the same at the bottom of the drop, they all had 8.39 m/s the only time the speed was different was at the top of the hill which was a few decimals off. Since the height and gravity never changes in the middle of the ride the speed will stay the same. So the mass does not affect the speed of the car in a frictionless environment but height and gravity do. m x g x h = 1/2 m x velocity^2 but it really g x h= 1/2 v^2 since the mass doesn't affect the speed 2(gxh)=v^2. Velocity is determined by gravity and height not mass. The PE at the top of the hill affects the KE, the PE gets transferred to KE as it goes down to drop. These new tweaks and heights would make the roller coaster way safer but keep it fun.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "51", "Raw": "60", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 121", "Quality": " 0.4959", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6881", "Comprehensive": "0.5920", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 13(3), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 23(2), 27(2), 32(2), 35(2), 42(1), 46(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 57(1), 59(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Like in trial 1 for mass and energy we used a 60 kg car which went down 5 meters and over a hill of 4.75 meters which supports our idea of using gravity to make the roller coaster go. The reason there is potential energy the higher you go is because like in trial 4 with 2 m for initial drop versus trial 2 with 5 m it had 2443 pe while trial 4 had 977 pe and pe means of energy that will be changed into an energy it happens like in trial 2 with a height of 5 m it had 2443 energy vs trial 4 with a height of 2 m 997 total energy like kinetic energy the more you go down the less potential energy you have and the more kinetic energy you have by turning the pe into ke. Energy never goes away it's always there just changing into different energies like pe turning into ke because energy can't be made or destroyed ever like in trials one through four for initial energy never went away it was just changing like in trial 2 the 2443 of pe energy it changed into ke energy but the amount did not change lessen or increase. The Initial drop has to be taller than the hill it has to go over if you just use kinetic energy because you need more energy to get over the hill so if it's the same height it will take more kinetic energy than potential energy why because with the data from add a hill in trial 1 it had 2449 pe but when it went over a hill of 4.95m it only had 17 ke left and 2432 pe with an initial drop of 5m so if the drop was the same height it would have not had enough ke energy to get over the hill. So if they match in height the roller coaster car wouldn't be able to get over. But in a world of no friction mass does not affect speed because in trials 1-4 on mass and speed is used a 40kg 50kg 55kg 45kg roller coaster cars, and they all got 8.27 m/s on the bottom of the drop and 5.41 m/s on the top of the hill and 8.27 m/s at the end of the ride the reason I got to where the highest speed is 8.27 m/s is that it was higher than 8.4 it would be dangerous like in trial 1 of drop height and speed with 9.88 m/s while you should still go above 6.7 or it will be to bring, so I could only get 8.27 m/s the fastest I could go with a 3.5 m drop with a 60 kg roller coaster car.

For example one of my trails didn't make it to the end because the hill was higher then the initial drop, The initial drop was about 3m were the hill was 5m there for the PE at the top of the initial drop was 2058j and the KE at the initial drop was 0j and the PE at the top of the hill was 2027j and the KE was  31j and the total energy ended up being 2058j so it did not make it up the hill. Potential energy stores the energy and kenetic Energy lets out the energy at the end of the hill. The potential energy will get smaller as the car goes down the drop were the kenetic energy will get larger. The relationship between the hill and initial drop is that the PE will always be bigger and the top and smaller on the bottom were the KE will always be smaller at the top and larger at the bottom. The mass can affect the PE and KE because the larger the mass the larger for example when the cars mass was 60kg the PE at the top of initial drop was 2936j and KE at the bottom was 2932j. Were when the mass was 40kg the PE at the top of the initial drop was 1957j and KE at the bottom of the drop was 1912j. Energy is tansformed Law Of Consevation of Energy because KE is being created at the end of the hill and then when going up the hill.  So my recommendation would be the have a larger drop and a smaller hill so the car can make it to the end and it can be a nice fun ride.  \n\nessay 2\n\nI think that the mass of the car does not matter because, in my data when the car masses were different the total energy at the end of the ride was the same.  For example when my car mass was 40kg the total energy was 8.24m/s and when the mass was 46kg witch was my largest mass it was also 8.26m/s. I decided to go with 46kg because, over all the speed and the end of drop and top of hill were faster. So then the familys can enjoy the ride with a faster speed. witch was proven from my data, the speed at the end of the drop 8.24m/s and the speed at top of hill was 4.58m/s witch wasnt the highest of all but the top of drop had more speed at the end of drop. The mass only impacts PE and KE becuase in the begining of the right thats when the energy will help the ride. It also affects height by determining if the ride makes it to the end. The Law of Conservation of Energy affects my design decisions because, at first I was going to have the hill be taller than the drop but that would not have worked because, there is not enough KE to make it up the hill.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "32", "Raw": "31", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 98", "Quality": " 0.3163", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3555", "Comprehensive": "0.3359", "Content Unit": "3(5), 10(3), 17(3), 27(2), 29(2), 32(2), 33(2), 39(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 52(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 3 [Weight: 5]\n\tSegment: ....................

Mass will also be similar if you have a mass of 60 the PE will be 2646 compared to a car with a mass of only 55 witch will have a PE of 2414 and that is a lot less for only leaving 5 mass behind.

The mass of the cart doesn't affect the velocity because gravity and the height are always the same, so the mass doesn't change the equation.

For example in my trials I found that with a drop height of 2 meters had a total energy of 1173 Jules, and with a drop height of 5 meters there was a total of 2443 Jules(The PE and KE is also just as high at times). This is proving that the greater the initial drop height is the greater the energy is. \n\nYou also need to know that your roller coaster wont make it to the end if the hill height is taller than the initial drop height.  For example in my trials I found that from an initial drop height of 5 and a hill height of 2-4 meters the coaster made it to the end from the hill height of 5 meters the car could not make it to the end of the roller coaster. This shows that the hill height needs to be less then your initial drop height. \n\n Another this is that if you have a greater mass you can have a larger PE and KE. For example in my trials I found that with a mass of the 40kg the PE was 978 Jules but with of mass of 60kg had a PE of 1468. Not only was the PE higher with a greater mass but the KE was higher too, with a mass of 40kg the KE was 978 but with a mass of 60 the KE was 1468. This shows that the larger your mass the greater your PE and KE will be. \n\n\n\n\n\nAn important thing to know is that the greater the initial drop height is the greater the speed will be. For example in my trials, from a initial drop height of 2.8 the speed was between 3.94-7.38, with an initial drop height of 5 the speed was between 7.67-9.37, although these might not be the best initial drop heights you can still see how the initial drop height really effects how much greater your speed can be. \n\nYou can also keep in mind that mass of your car doesn't effect the speed of the roller coaster. For example I learned in my trials that with a mass of 40kg the speed is between 5.43-8.28 and with a mass of 60kg its also between 5.43-8.28, so the mass doesn't really effect the speed. The mass cancels itself out and the gravity, height, and velocity stays the same so mass isn't an important factor when it comes to speed.

This will give you the most energy. When I tested the drop height at 5 meters the potential energy was 2443J and when I did it at 4.5 meters it was 2022J. Also, the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2442J and at 4.5 it was 2198J. I think the weight of the cart should be 60 kilograms. this will also give you the most energy. When I had it at 60 the potential energy was 2932J and when I did it at 50 it was 1222J. Also at the bottom, the kinetic energy was 2930J and for 50 it was at 1221J. I also think we should add a loop and hill. The order should be initial drop, loop, and hill. I think the loop should be 4 meters high. I also think the hill should be 3.5 meters high. With our previously mentioned drop height, we should be able to make it through those obstacles easily. Potential energy is the energy stored before use. The potential energy is what we will get from the top of the initial drop. The kinetic energy is what's keeping the cart going through the track. Energy can't be created or destroyed so the potential energy turns into kinetic energy and then the energy gets turned into things like heat energy when the ride stops. Mass and energy have a direct relationship, as mass goes up so does the energy. After the ride is over the energy will be turned into other versions of energy like heat. The maximum PE is at the top of the initial drop. The maximum KE is at the bottom of the initial drop. Mass does not affect speed. When the mass was 50 kg it was at a speed of 9.83 and when it was at 60 it was also 9.83.  The higher the initial drop height the higher the speed.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3957cc3a9535eae0b8", "class_id": "1", "teacher_id": "PN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "Dear Gonzales Family,\n\nI'm going to tell you what I found out with my experiments. \n\nFirst, the relationship between height and potential energy is direct and I know that because when I increased the height of my initial drop. The higher the number of potential energy I got at the top of my drop. Also, when I found out that when I increase the height of the drop the higher the kinetic energy is at the bottom, and height and kinetic energy have a direct relationship. My first trial was 5-meters and my potential energy at the top was 2932J and my kinetic energy at the bottom was 2930J. During my first trial, my total energy was 2932J. My last trial was 2-meters and the potential energy at the top was 1173J and my kinetic energy at the bottom was 1172J. My total energy for my last trial was 1173J. The drop height I chose to get the maximum amount of potential energy was 3.5-meters so that we can also get the closest speed to 8.4. If the roller coaster is taller it will go faster because it builds up more potential energy. Again if you look at my data when the drop was 2.25meters the speed at the bottom of the drop was 6.63m/s. If you look at the drop height of 3.5meters the speed at the bottom of the drops was 8.27m/s so that's why I chose 3.5meters.\n\nThe changes in potential energy while the cart is going down the roller coaster are that potential energy will decrease and turn into kinetic energy due to the Law of Conservation of Energy that states you can't create or destroy energy it can only turn into a different form of energy. So at the bottom, there is 0 potential energy because you aren't moving anywhere and don't have the potential to move anywhere.\n\nWhen you get to the step of adding a hill to your roller coaster you need to remember that your drop height needs to be bigger than the hill. The cart won't make it over if the hill is bigger. When the hill was the same height as the drop in my trial it showed that the cart didn't make it over. The cart had just fallen back down the roller coaster. In another one of my trials, I had the hill height at 4meters and it went over with 2937J of potential energy. When the hill height was 5meters, the potential energy started at 2939J and it only dropped down to 2424 but it couldn't make it over the hill. Then when you look at 3 meters. It's the perfect amount of energy to get a thrill and to have more people at your park. That's why I think 3 meters is the best option so you can get the maximum amount of potential energy with the cart still going over. That way your roller coaster can be fun and have more loops and hills.\n\nWhen you're designing your roller coaster you need to think about the mass of the cart. I tried 40,50 and 60kgs. When it was 40kgs the potential energy at the top was 1955J and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1954J. When I tried 50kgs the potential energy at the top was 2443J and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2443J.\nAfter that, I tried 60kgs and the potential energy at the top was 2932J and at the bottom, the kinetic energy was 2930J. So I'm recommending the 60kg cart because then you can get the maximum amount of energy and will be able to fit more people. Mass and potential energy have a direct relationship which means if mass goes up so does potential energy. Mass and kinetic energy also have a direct relationship which also means that if mass goes up so does kinetic energy. The mass has zero relationships with speed.\n\nPotential energy turns into kinetic energy as the cart goes down the roller coaster. The total energy is all of the energy in the ride. Again if the roller coaster is taller it has more time to gain more potential energy before it goes down the hill and if you have more potential energy you have more kinetic energy because all the potential energy changes into kinetic energy. If you have a lot of potential energy you will have more total energy because it's the total energy for the ride.\n\nThe law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed only converted from one form of energy to another. This means that the roller coaster always has the same amount of energy unless it's added. \n\nMass affects PE and KE because if the cart weighs more it will gain more energy going up the hill.\n\nThanks for your attention!\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "66", "Raw": "79", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.5940", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.9060", "Comprehensive": "0.7500", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 9(4), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 13(3), 14(3), 15(3), 16(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 31(2), 32(2), 33(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

For my example today I'm going to be using a roller coaster with an initial drop height of 5 m, a car mass of 40kg, and a hill height of 3 meters. First I am going to be talking about how the changes in PE and KE happen while going DOWN the drop. PE is defined as energy stored and not being used so at the top of the hill the energy is 1955 but it's all stored waiting the be changed into KE.  The KE at the top of the hill is 0 because nothing is happening where it needs that energy so it's in resting. Next, I will be talking about how the height of the drop affects the potential and kinetic energy. The PE at the top is 1955 with all the energy stored and the KE at the bottom is 1954 when all the energy was el\nThe relationship between mass, PE, and KE is direct at certain times. At the top of the roller coaster, the mass is accelerating and so is the PE at the bottom of the roller coaster the mass is still going us so the KE is as well. \n\ndepending on how high the drop is will change the amount of the PE and KE if your coaster has a height of a 5-meter drop your car is gonna needs less energy to make it ever and down because the heigh gives it more force. At the bottom of the coaster, the PE is gonna be 1 but the KE is gonna be much larger because the energy changed from PE into KE.\n \nIn the law of science, energy can not be created or taken away the only way it can be changed is when it switches from kinetic to potential and vis versa. The way that happens is when the roller coaster moves so all the store's energy/PE turned into KE because it is the force and motion to keep it moving. \n\nThe relationship between drop height and hill height is inverse because if the roller coaster is on flat ground the first drop needs to be bigger than the rest of the hills for it to make it all the way through. An inverse relationship means if one goes up the other goes down and one goes down the other goes up. If the first one is up/big the second one needs to be smaller/farther down. \n\nThe relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is inverse because when the cart is at the top of the coaster the PE is what is the highest and the KE is what is lower but then the cart goes down the track and the PE changes to a lower number and the KE is what changes into bigger and as we know inverse means one goes up the other goes down. \n\nThe height of the initial drop will increase the speed of the car because there is more force acting in the car. However, the mass of the car does not affect the speed of the car it is the friction that causes the speed for example when you have a baseball it drops very fast because it is covering less surface area and going right through the air. Compared to a piece of paper it is more area and is \"lifted\" more by the air than the basketball.\n\n The mass of the car does not affect the PE or the KE what matters is the friction the car has to break the air not the weight of the car. So no matter the weight of the car it will go the same speed because ur friction will not change when different people ride it.\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "45", "Raw": "45", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 115", "Quality": " 0.3913", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5161", "Comprehensive": "0.4537", "Content Unit": "0(5), 3(5), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 19(3), 22(2), 23(2), 27(2), 33(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 46(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 7 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: ....................

Here are some of the things I have come up with.  Initial drop, with a high initial drop you get more PE which means you get more total energy.  In my data, a drop of 5 meters had 2443 J of total and potential energy while a drop of 2 meters only had 977 J of total and potential energy. Since the initial drop is the highest drop the amount of PE you have is going to be the amount of total energy you have.\n\nHill height, you are going to want hills in your coaster to make it more fun but how high should those hills be?  Hill height is important because you want your hills to be high but not so high that you can't make it over them.  In my tests a good hill height should be less than the one before it.  With an initial drop of 5 meters a 5 meter hill right after it is not a good idea.  At the top of the initial drop the cart had 2449 J of PE but once it went down and back up the hill it had 2449 J of PE at the top of the hill and only 6 J of KE, the cart didn't even make it over.  With the same initial drop of 5 meters but a 4 meter hill height the cart had 2448 J of PE at the top, 1911 J of PE on top of the hill, and 536 J of KE at the top of the hill.  The KE kept going up as the hills got smaller then the initial drop.\n\nMass, mass plays a big roll in PE and KE but not in speed.  During my trials I adjusted the mass of the cart and found that the heavier the cart the more energy it has.  With a drop height 5 meters and a cart mass of 40 kg the cart had 1955 J of PE at the top of the hill and 1954 J of KE at the bottom of the hill. But a cart of 60 kg had 2932 J of PE at the top of the hill and 2930 J of KE at the bottom of the hill.  This shows that mass has a relationship with energy.  On the other hand, mass has no relationship with speed.  In my experiments I kept the initial drop and hill height the same and just changed the carts mass.  With a mass of 40 kg the cart had 9.88 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop, 7.76 m/s at the top of the hill, and 9.88 m/s at the end of the ride.  I then did the same thing but with a cart of 60 kg and got the same numbers confirming that mass and speed have no relationship.\n\nEnergy transfer, energy transfer is when the PE turns into KE.  This happens when the cart starts going down the hill.  At the top of the hill the cart has PE since it is not moving, it is the potential amount of energy the cart could have if it where to go down the hill.  Once the cart starts in motion the PE will turn into KE since it isn't potential anymore it is happening.  You should have the same amount of starting PE as ending KE since there is no friction but, in the real world dome of the energy will turn to heat energy so there will be more PE than KE.\n\nLaw of conservation of energy, this law states that energy can't be created or destroyed.  For instance in a friction less area if a cart at the top of the initial drop had 1000 J of PE (just and example) and in went down the hill at the bottom it would have 1000 J of PE.  No energy was created and no energy was destroyed.  As we know from our test this can change though.  The higher the hill the more PE which means more total energy.  So if the hill height goes up so does the total energy same goes for hill height going down the total energy goes down.  The total energy by the way is just what ever the amount of PE there is at the initial drop.\n\nI think that's all you need to know about roller coasters so lets go check out this one that was recently made that checks all these boxes.

Also, I found that when I increased the height of the initial drop the kinetic energy increased at the bottom of the hill. On my first trial, I put the initial drop height at 5 meters and I had 1955J of potential energy and 0J of kinetic energy at the top of the drop, after the drop I had 1J of potential energy and 1954J of kinetic energy, my total energy was 1955J. In the last trial, I did a 2-meter initial drop height and I had 782J of potential energy and 0J of kinetic energy at the top of the drop. At the bottom of the drop, I had 0J of potential energy and 781J of kinetic energy, my total energy was 782J. This would mean if you wanted as much potential energy as possible you would need to make the initial drop the highest it can go but still needs to be safe. When you're looking at the speed of your roller coaster you don't want your speed to go over 8.4m/s/s but you don't want it to go under 6.7m/s/s When I tested a 5-meter drop height my max speed was 9.89m/s/s. When I tested out a 2.75-meter drop height and the maximum speed was 7.66m/s/s which is pretty slow for a maximum speed. My recommended drop height would be 3.5 meters tall because then your roller coaster won't be too fast because then it is unsafe. When I tested the drop height of 4 meters the speed was 8.83m/s/s which is over 8.4m/s/s therefore it is an unsafe drop height. I also did a trial at 3 meters and the top speed was 7.66m/s/s which was a little slow for a maximum speed so I tested a drop height of 3.5 meters and the maximum speed was 8.27m/s/s, therefore it is fast but not unsafe.\n\nWhen you send your roller-coaster down a drop all of the potential energy turns into kinetic energy, at the bottom of the hill when your cart is stopped you won't have any potential energy because you are not moving and don't have the potential to go anywhere. The Law of Conservation of Energy says that you cannot create or take away energy. It can only change to different forms of energy. For example, when you have 0J of kinetic energy at the top of the hill you have 0J but when all of that potential energy turns to kinetic energy, you didn't destroy the potential energy it just changed forms from potential energy to kinetic energy. \n\nWhen you're looking to insert a hill into your roller-coaster track you need to take into consideration how high your hill height is. When I tested out hill height I used the height I recommended of 5 meters. When I set the hill height at 2 meters at the top of the hill I had 786J of potential energy and also at the top of the hill there was 1169J of kinetic energy. When I tested the hill height of 5 meters my cart did not make it over the hill. At the top of the initial drop, there was 1959J of potential energy and 0J of kinetic energy. At the top of the 5-meter hill, I still had 1958J of potential energy and 1J of kinetic energy. This proved that the hill height cannot be 5 meters because no matter the initial drop height the cart won't make it over. When I tested this out, I used an initial drop height of 5 meters, when I tested this trial with a 5-meter hill height my cart didn't make it over. If you use a smaller height than 5-meters for the hill height your cart will make it over but the smaller the hill the less potential and kinetic energy. You also don't want your initial drop height to be smaller than your hill height because then your cart for sure won't make it over. To have the most amount of potential energy at the top of the hill and throughout the ride, I recommend 3 meters for a hill height.\n\nWhen thinking about the mass of your cart you need to take into consideration how much mass your cart can take without failing to go over any hills or loops. When you increase the mass, the potential and kinetic energy go up as well because there is a direct relationship between them. When I did a cart mass trial I tried 40kg, 50kg, and 60kg. When I set my cart at 40kg with a 5-meter drop height I had 1955J of potential energy and 0J of kinetic energy at the top of the drop, after the drop I had 1955J of kinetic energy and 0J of potential energy. When I tried the max mass of the cart at 60kg I had 2932J of potential energy and 0J of kinetic energy, at the bottom of the hill I had 2932J of kinetic energy and 0J of potential energy. Mass affects potential and kinetic energy because the more mass you have the more potential and kinetic energy you have, but because you have more potential and kinetic energy does not mean your cart is going faster. It is better to have a bigger cart mass because you will have more energy and be able to fit more people at once. My recommended mass for your cart is 60kg because mass does not affect the speed of the roller coaster and if you make the cart the biggest it can go, then you will be able to hold the most people at once.\n\nWhen talking about energy transfer you need to keep in mind the amount of energy that transfers from potential energy to kinetic energy. When you look at the trials that I did you can see that when you get to the bottom of the drop all of the potential energy transfers to kinetic energy. Then when you go up the hill you gain a little bit more potential energy and then it all transfers back to kinetic energy. At the end of the ride, there should be 0J of potential energy and the kinetic energy should be the amount of potential energy you have to start out with, your total energy should be the same amount of kinetic energy you have at the bottom.\n\n\n\nThank you for taking my plans for your roller coaster into consideration!\n\n\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "84", "Raw": "85", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.6391", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.9748", "Comprehensive": "0.8069", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 9(4), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 14(3), 15(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

This drop height would offer the most potential and kinetic energy, therefor producing more G-force. The height of the initial drop and the amount of potential and kinetic energy have a direct relationship. This means that the higher up the initial drop is, the more potential and kinetic energy it will have. Overall, this means the more total energy, and because energy can't be created or destroyed when the potential energy transforms to kinetic energy when the roller coaster car goes into motion, there will always be the same amount of energy, never more and never less. You can see this from the research I gathered with a drop height of 3 meters the potential energy at the top of the initial drop is 1466 Joules. The kinetic energy at the top of the initial drop was 0 Joules. While the roller coaster was in motion, the kinetic energy was, 1465 Joules and the potential energy was 1 Joule. The total energy of the roller coaster with an initial drop of 3 meters is, 1466 Joules. When I increased the initial drop height to 5 meters, the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was 2443 Joules, and the kinetic energy was 0. At the bottom of the initial drop the potential energy was 1 and the kinetic energy was 2442 Joules. As shown, the height change of 2 meters made the potential energy at the top of the initial drop go up by 977 Joules. The kinetic energy at the top stayed the same at 0 because the roller coaster car isn't moving. The kinetic energy went up by 977 Joules when we went from 3 to 5 meters. I think that the hill height should be 4 meters. The hill height has to be less than the initial drop height because of the transformation of energy. The roller coaster car wouldn't have enough energy to get the car up the hill if it is taller than the initial drop. With a hill height of 4 meters, the hill will still be high and exciting, but low enough for the roller coaster car to go over the hill with ease. In my experiments when the hill height was 4 meters the potential energy, at the top of the hill was 1965 Joules, and the kinetic energy at the top of the hill was 483 Joules. The total energy was, 2448 Joules. The car mass of the roller coaster should be 50 kg because this lets you have enough capacity for several people but not too much where the roller coaster car has a hard time getting up the hills. It's a perfect medium for the mass. From my trials, I collected data that shows that when the car had a mass of 40 kg, its potential energy was 1955 at the top of the initial drop and had a kinetic energy of 1954 at the bottom of the drop. The total energy was 1955 Joules. When I increased the car's mass to 50 kg, the potential energy at the top of the hill was 2434 Joules and the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop was 2433. Overall it had a total energy of, 2434 Joules. Along with the greater car mass having more energy, it can also hold more people. And since the mass of the roller coaster car and the amount of potential and kinetic energy have a direct relationship, when we increased the mass the amount of energy increased.\n After further testing, I have found that the following heights and mass would be most beneficial for this roller coaster. I think the initial drop height should be 3.5 this allows the riders to have the most fun while being safe. I've discovered an initial drop height is the highest we can go while staying safe speed range. A hill height 3 or less. This hill height allows the roller coaster car to get over the hill with ease, and the hill is tall enough to be very enjoyable for the riders.The higher the roller coaster is, the more speed or velocity the roller coaster car will have. However, the mass of the roller coaster car doesn't affect the speed. No matter the mass of the roller coaster car, since there is no friction on our roller coaster, the speed will always be the same. We know that the height of the roller coaster car is directly related to the amount of PE, KE, Total energy. But how is does mass impact these three things? Mass also has a direct relationship with the amount of energy. The more mass the roller coaster car has, the more PE at the top of the initial drop, the more KE at the bottom of the initial drop and the more total energy. The potential energy at the top  of the initial drop will be the KE at the end of the roller coaster if there is no friction. This means the total energy stays the same throughout the entire ride. So no matter where you are in the roller coaster, you will always have the same amount of energy as when you started. However, when there is friction, it can seem like you slow down. This is because the friction can slow down the roller coaster car. In this scenario, some PE transfers into thermal energy, which is when thermal energy or heat is created mainly along the tracks. Since our roller coaster has no friction and the law of conservation of mass states energy can not be created or destroyed, the beginning and end of the ride will always have the same amount of total energy but the amount of PE and KE throughout the ride will vary.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "65", "Raw": "73", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.5489", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.8372", "Comprehensive": "0.6930", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 13(3), 15(3), 18(3), 20(2), 21(2), 22(2), 23(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 37(1), 40(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3957cc3a9535eae0bf", "class_id": "1", "teacher_id": "PN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "  There is a direct relationship between the height of the initial drop and the potential energy the has at the top of the initial drop because the height of the initial drop is the highest, if the initial drop increases the potential energy goes up. Itâs the same with kinetic energy but at the bottom of the initial drop. The farther you fall the faster you go, height affects the velocity. And if the height increase so does kinetic energy. If the initial drop is very tall it will have more potential energy when going down and kinetic energy when going up. You find the total energy by adding the potential energy at the bottom of the drop and the kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop. The taller the initial height the more potential energy and kinetic energy there will be.\n When the car is at the highest point which is the initial drop it is 100% potential energy, while it goes down the hill it becomes 50% kinetic energy and 50% potential energy because the gravitational potential energy is transferred to kinetic energy and the car speeds up. When it is fully at the bottom there is 0 of both and then it starts going back up it continues as kinetic energy but once it keeps going up the other hill it loses kinetic energy and gains gravitational potential energy.\nI did 4 initial drop height tests so I could choose one I did 2.72 m,3.49 m and 5 m. I ended up choosing 4.51 m the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was 2201 J and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2200 J, and the total energy was 2201 J. Next, I did the hill tests I did 2.5 m,3.21 m,4.23 m, and \n5 m. 5 m didn't make it over so I chose the next best which was 3.21 m The reason you don't want to make the hill taller than the initial drop is because It canât go over because it wonât have enough kinetic energy. I tried out some different car masses like 40 kg,49 kg,55 kg and 60 kg.I ended up choosing 49 kg, the potential energy at the top was 2166 J and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1999 J resulting in the total energy being 216 J.\nThere is a direct relationship between the mass of the car and the potential energy the car has at the top of the initial drop, if you increase the mass the potential energy will go up because it's larger. There is also a direct relationship between the mass of the car and the kinetic energy the car has at the bottom of the initial drop,  if you increase the mass when it is at the bottom the kinetic energy will go up because of the larger amount it has to push.  \nThe maximum potential energy is at the highest point at the top of the initial drop, the maximum kinetic energy is at the lowest point. Kinetic energy is energy that an object has as a result of its motion. All moving objects possess kinetic energy, which is determined by the mass and speed of the object. Potential energy is the energy an object has as a result of its position. Potential energy is stored energy that has not yet been released. The law of conservation of energy states that within a closed system, energy can change form, but it cannot be created or destroyed. When the roller coaster cart goes down the drop and loses potential energy and gains kinetic energy the energy isn't being destroyed it is just changing from one energy to another.\n\nMy final decision for my initial drop height is 3.6 and 3.02. This way the initial drop is taller than the hill and it is exactly 8.4 m/s. I left the mass of my car at 50 kg because the mass doesn't affect how fast it will go because they don't have any relationship. Height and speed have a direct relationship because if you make the height of the drop taller it will go faster. If the drop is taller it will have more potential energy at the top and kinetic energy at the bottom which would make the total energy more than if it was a shorter drop. The law of conservation of energy affects the design because when the energy turns from potential energy to kinetic energy that is an example of the law. If the law didn't exist the cart wouldn't be able to get back over the hill because the energy would be destroyed after it went down the initial drop and then it would somehow supposedly be created again instead of transferring.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "28", "Raw": "41", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 90", "Quality": " 0.4556", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4702", "Comprehensive": "0.4629", "Content Unit": "0(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 8(4), 11(3), 27(2), 32(2), 42(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 57(1), 60(1), 61(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... the has at the top of the initial drop if the initial drop\n\t         .................... increases the potential energy goes up\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 6 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: ....................

First of all, you must understand how it works. You see the taller the initial drop the better because the taller it is, the more potential energy is produced, and the more potential energy there is to convert to kinetic energy in the initial drop, the more range we have when it comes to selecting heights for loops and hills, which can pretty much be any height that is lower than the initial drop. You see, assuming there is no friction, every single piece of potential energy produced at the top of the hill will turn to or will have been converted to kinetic energy once reaching the bottom of the hill, and then changing almost completely back to potential energy once reaching the top of a hill or loop with just a slight amount of kinetic energy left to boost the car over the hill the rest of the way. \n\n   Of course, there are safety limitations, and due to these the maximum speed the rollercoaster can go is 8.4/m/s. But this does not change anything. In simple terms: the more potential energy we have from the initial drop the farther the car goes, and the higher hills and loops can be before reaching the limit. Of course, the mass the car has does not affect the speed of the initial drop or along the course, it affects for how long it will sustain this speed, or in other words, the car's inertia. \n\n    To conclude, with this information I believe the best measurements and weights to ensure optimal rider enjoyment & safety would be: a 3.59-meter Initial drop, a 3.5-meter Loop, and then ending it off with a 3.25 hill.\n\nSebastian Mejia-Gonzalez (Mechanical Engineer)", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "19", "Raw": "17", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 71", "Quality": " 0.2394", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.1950", "Comprehensive": "0.2172", "Content Unit": "7(4), 11(3), 27(2), 32(2), 33(2), 44(1), 50(1), 52(1), 57(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

I know this because when the height was 2 meters tall the potential energy was 977 at the top, but when it was 3 meters tall the potential energy at the top was 1466. And the car has the highest potential energy at the initial drop because that's at its highest point. Now there is not much difference but you can't go higher than 3.5 for the initial drop on flat ground, because then the speed will be over 8.4 and then that wouldn't be safe. Now the relationship between the height and the initial drop of the kinetic energy at the bottom is direct because as height increases so does the kinetic energy. Now I know this is true because height affects velocity. The further you fall, the more you have to accelerate. Now height and potential energy is the same way, it is a direct relationship because of the more height the more potential energy. I know this because it's in the formula mxgxh. The relationship between potential energy and kinetic energy, and total energy is direct because the more potential energy and the more kinetic energy, the more total energy. The relationship between potential and kinetic energy when going down the drop is different though because the potential energy at the bottom of the drop is always 0 But the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop all depended on how much potential energy there was at the top of the drop, which also depended on how high the drop was. Like I said before. So now for hills, the hill always has to be lower than the initial drop. So in this case, if my initial drop was 3.5 I think the best height for your hill should be 3 m because then you can have many hills after that. They just have to get smaller and smaller. Because if you start with 1710 J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop and then you add in a 3 m hill, with the potential energy of 1452 you still have plenty of potential, and kinetic energy to get to the end. But when the car is going up the hill it decreases in kinetic energy and increases in potential. Now when talking about making it to the end of the roller coaster you have to look at the mass of the car. because if the car has a lot of mass it's going to have more potential energy and kinetic energy because they are both a direct relationship. and I know this because it's stated in both formulas, mxgxh, and 1/2mxv squared. But if you have a car with less mass it will have less potential energy and less kinetic energy. I think you should have a car with a mass of 50 because it's between 60 and 40. The higher the initial drop is the more speed there will be. But mass does not affect speed, so if you had a roller coaster that weighed 400lbs, and one that weighed 300lbs the 300lbs roller coaster will not go any faster than the one that weighs 400lbs. Now you may be wondering how we get all of this energy, well because energy does not get created, or destroyed the energy is already there. because when the car is going down the hill it increases in kinetic energy, and then at the end, it stops and goes from kinetic energy to potential energy.

After the initial drop, I would do a 3.5-meter loop because it's significantly shorter than the initial drop so there's no worry that your car won't have enough kinetic energy. then you should do a small hill close to 2.5 meters because it's small to end on but still have enough kinetic energy. the higher the drop is, the more acceleration and kinetic energy you get and the lower the drop is, the more potential energy there is.\n\nFor the mass of the car, I suggest it to be 60 kg because the more mass that you have, the more potential energy you'll get throughout the whole ride and the more kinetic energy you'll have at the bottom. also as the car falls down the coaster, it will get more and more kinetic energy because potential energy converts into kinetic energy. I tested the mass of the car at 40 kg and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1954 and when I did 60 kg car mass the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2930.\n\nevery object has potential energy, and every moving object has kinetic energy. the law of conservation of energy makes it so that potential energy can turn into kinetic energy because it stays that energy cannot be created or destroyed. so the energies just turn into different energies. the relationship between mass and kinetic and potential energy is a direct relationship because when the mass goes up the kinetic and potential energy goes up and when the mass goes down the kinetic and potential energy will go down.

There is a direct relationship between the height of the initial drop and kinetic energy because more height means more kinetic energy. \n\nIn my opinion, the mass of the car should be  60 kgs because more mass equals more potential energy at the top. As the car descends down the hill it will gain kinetic energy because the potential energy transfers into kinetic energy. When I put the mass of the car at 40 kg the Kinetic energy at the bottom was 1954 J. But when I put the car mass at 60 kg the kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill was 2930 J. This also proves that there is a direct relationship between mass and KE. The more mass the more KE.  Therefore I think 60 kgs is the best mass for the car. \n\nIt is also important to remember that mass affects PE and KE. The more mass the car has the more PE and KE there are. Less mass equals less PE and KE because there is a direct relationship. \n\nThe first hill should be 2.5 meters because the car will already have a lot of potential energy at the bottom of the first hill because of the direct relationship between the mass of the car and the height of the initial drop so it will be able to get up the 2.5-meter hill easily. \n\nEnergy is able to transfer from potential energy to kinetic energy because of the conservation of energy. It can change from one type of energy to the other type of energy very easily which is very important for roller coasters. Every object has potential energy and every object moving has kinetic energy. \n\nAs the roller coaster goes down the hill the energy transforms into different types. For example, the highest point of a roller coaster is when the car has the most PE. The car is not moving so the KE is 0. Halfway down the hill pe and KE are the same. As it works its way back up the hill the PE gets greater and the KE gets less and less as it loses speed. \n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "33", "Raw": "47", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 100", "Quality": " 0.4700", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5390", "Comprehensive": "0.5045", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 7(4), 12(3), 15(3), 23(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 40(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 60 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... because more height means more kinetic energy\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The height of my initial drop will be 5 meters. This is because the higher the initial drop, the more kinetic energy the car will have at the bottom,(the speed at the bottom of the drop is 9.860), and the potential energy at the top will increase as well. energy is when it changes from one type to another. Potential energy is what is stored in an object, that then gets released into kinetic energy when the car goes down the drop. that way, the energy never gets created or destroyed. The mass of the car will be 60 KG. I chose this because there was more kinetic energy in my data when I put more mass on the car. The potential energy increased as well because there is a direct relationship between mass and potential energy, as well as mass and kinetic energy. Lastly, the initial drop affects the hill height because the more kinetic energy the initial drop gives to the car, the more energy the car has to go over the next hill which will be 3 meters. Height and mass affect speed because the more height there is, the more PE there is and so then the PE gets converted into KE. Mass affects speed because the more mass a cart has the slower it goes on the roller coaster. The Law of conservation affects my design because the energy cannot be created or destroyed and so that's why you have to make the initial drop have the highest height in my design. PE and KE at the bottom are related because they can be converted into each other. Mass affects PE because the more mass the car has, the more PE there is. But, the more mass a car has, the less KE there is. The PE at the top gets converted into KE when the car goes down the hill. All in all, My initial drop will be 5 meters.

Also the higher the drop the more potential energy it will have, it also applies to the hill height the higher the hill height the more potential energy the car will have.\n\nMy group and I actually designed a roller coaster for you guys! Are initial hill drop is 5m and that has 2447 joules of potential energy. Our hill height is also 4.03 m with 2448 joules of potential energy and it does make it over the hill. Our car mass is also 5kg which is a pretty good weight for the roller coaster. The way this all works makes the roller car able to go over the hill and still have a pretty tall hill with a good initial drop. The way that our roller coaster works will be great for your family!\n\nAlso the relationship between the hill height and initial drop is that the initial drop has a higher drop than the hill height, the best thing i would recommend you do is have the initial drop higher than the hill height by .5 m so that way there is enough energy for the car to get over both hills. Also the mass of the cart does not effect the way the car rides at all. In fact the height and of the hill and initial drop is what has to do with the speed because we did a study of different car masses and they all ended up with the highest speed being the same.

This is a good idea because if you want to make it to the end without stopping  we have to add more KE and PE at the drop than the hill. Another good idea is making sure you have more KE so you have more momentum to make it to the end of the ride. For this we would need some small bumps or a big drop to add much more PE and KE for the ride to keep on moving. \n\n\n      The reason behind my designs decisions is because we want a ride that's best suited for people. Also so that we could see if we can make a ride with science, and we can. With hills we added the KE and be increased and the speed can be faster, making it an easy ride to the end.

While deciding how high the initial drop height should be, you need to think about how much PE it has at the top. The PE at the top of the drop will be transferred into KE due to the Law of Conservation of Energy. The higher the initial drop is, the more PE there is to be transferred to KE. The initial drop height needs to be high enough so that the car has enough PE to get over a hill. That hill needs to be shorter than the initial drop height. W know this because while experimenting with hill heights, we saw that a height of 5m, while the initial drop height was 5m, caused the car not to make it over the hill. You also need to consider the mass of the car. Based on the data collected, the higher mass gives it more PE at the top of the initial drop. With a car with greater mass, like 58kg, you'd get a large amount of PE (2838j) but with the lighter car of 54kg, you only get 2642j. To make the roller coaster fun, the speed should be high. While experimenting with the simulation, we saw that the higher the initial drop is, the higher the speed is. When the height was 5m, the ride went 9.87m/s. When it was only 2.75m high, the speed was only 8.27m/s. Although it should be fun, it also needs to be safe, and it has to be under 8.4m/s to be safe. That means that it would work to make the height 3.5m. When thinking about the Mass of the car, it doesn't matter. The equation for speed does not include mass, therefore the mass doesn't affect the speed. While experimenting, we saw that no matter how large/small the mass of the car was, the speed stayed the same. When it was 40kg, the speed at the end of the ride was 8.27m/s.

They should have a higher drop height because the higher up the cars are the more potential energy they have. In the data that I collected it proved this because  I found that when the drop height is at five meters then the potential energy is 2,443 joules at the top, 2443 joules at the bottom, and a total energy of 2443 versus a drop height of two meters which had a potential energy of only 975 joules at the top, a kinetic energy of 975 joules at the bottom and a total energy of 975 joules. When the coaster is going down the hill the potential energy, which is the energy that is stored in the coaster, transforms into kinetic energy, which is how much energy that the car has as it's moving. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, so the amount of total energy doesn't change and the potential energy at the top is the same as the kinetic energy at the bottom.The hill also can't be the same height or any higher then the initial drop, this is because the amount of kinetic energy has to exceed the amount needed to climb the ramp or else the car will either stop and roll backwards or stall at the top. The mass of the coaster doesn't matter, I know this because in the testing the mass of the car didn't change the speed at all.

I say making more speed would make it more fun, so what would make a roller coaster faster or funner? \n\nThe very most important thing about a roller coaster is its initial drop. The initial drop depends on how much potential energy is made for it to be that fast. Potential plays a huge role because it connects to kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the energy that is made from moment. Potential energy is the energy that is potentially made and stored up. Example like the initial drop, with the roller coaster on the edge of that drop. All that PE/potential energy is built up, when the roller coaster/Cart of the roller coaster goes down the hill/drop it creates tons of kinetic energy. The more kinetic energy made the faster its speed is. So what makes a roller coaster fast? The friction? The Mass? The height?\n\nThe initial drop is one of them, the drop stores up a lot of potential energy. The higher the drop the more PE is built up. Lets say the drop is 5.00 meters and 2124 PE is built up that PE converts to KE because of Newton's law, Newton's Law is when energy cannot be destroyed or produce but is converted to something else such as PE that is built up then turning it into KE because of its action. The initial drop matters as because the higher the drop the more speed but then there friction. Friction plays a big role because it affects the roller coaster speed by A LOT. So what is friction that affects the Roller Coaster's speed? Well friction for example a carpet the friction of it is like the texture as you run full speed and try to slide you'll probably get carpet burn and go no where because of the friction. Now compared to a smooth floor with no carpet that is made out of a flat stone with little friction. Try sliding on that sense there is basically no friction the speed in which you slide goes way farther than when you slide on the carpet. But when you slide its also less painful. Apply that concept on a roller coaster, too much of a material that has A LOT of friction would make the speed slow down by A LOT. Less friction for a roller coaster would mean faster speed and nothing slowing the acceleration rate down.\nSo what else could help a roller coasters speed? Its mass matters as if its to light the speed would not go so fast. On an initial drop if the mass is A LOT the amount of PE stored would also mean a lot converting that to KE the speed of the acceleration down to the button of the track would go super fast. Mass does not affect the speed but instead the stored up energy because for example if the cart weight 5 tons with a 5 meter intial drop the PE would be a lot stored up then converted to KE goes down and around. The speed stays the same as my data shows: Speed at Bottom of Drop (m/s)\nMass (kg)\nSpeed at Top of Hill (m/s)\nSpeed at End of Ride (m/s)\n100\n9.88\n7.04\n9.88\n55\n9.88\n6.98\n9.88\n40\n9.88\n7.04\n9.88\n45\n9.88\n7.09\n9.8\n\nTherefore my roller coaster will be very fun with high speed and without it stopping in the middle of the roller coaster. With my high initial drop it will store up PE and when it goes down my PE converts to enough KE to make it out of the entire ride. My roller coaster will consist of minimal speed with it having to build up enough PE energy and releasing enough KE energy for the entire ride but will also be fun!\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "62", "Raw": "45", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 132", "Quality": " 0.3409", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5161", "Comprehensive": "0.4285", "Content Unit": "3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 9(4), 13(3), 15(3), 19(3), 21(2), 23(2), 27(2), 28(2), 35(2), 36(1), 43(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 52 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... how much potential energy is made for it to be that fast\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 60 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... because it connects to kinetic energy\n\t", "sentence 5 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 4 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: ....................

The ride needs a lot of power to make it up the next hill. So far I believe that this ride needs to start at 5 m tall and the mass of the car needs to be as high as possible in order to make it up the next hill. Because the higher the mass the more energy the car uses on the ride. The law of conservation teaches us that PE is when the car is not in motion and is the amount of energy that the car could have and KE is when the car is in motion or how much energy the car actually uses. So far the best results of our tests have been from cars that have more mass and start higher than the first hill. The data shows that the higher the hill the more PE and KE the car has. The more mass the car has the higher amount of energy the car has in all. The more energy that is in your ride the faster and more thrilling it will be! \n\nMy team's roller coaster will be 5 meters tall and very long with a few hills. because we plan on making the drop height 5 meters tall and all the other hills will be smaller than that so around 3.5 meters. For the mass of the cars, it actually doesn't affect the speed at all. Because assuming all the cars are dropped at the same height the velocity stays the same and the velocity determines how fast the car goes. In trials, 2,3,4 of mass and speed all of the cars were dropped from the same height but the cars had different masses 2=40 3=50, and 4=60 at the end of the ride they were all going 8.27 m/s. and at the bottom of the drop, they were all within 2-3 m/s. And at the top of the hill, they were all within 1-2 m/s. This shows that the mass of the car doesn't affect speed. Based on all of the trials we have decided that the drop height has to be 5 meters. We got the best results from the drop height of 5. For the mass of the car we decided that anything could work but from mass and speed, we saw that 50 kg went just slightly faster. \n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "26", "Raw": "49", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 86", "Quality": " 0.5698", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5619", "Comprehensive": "0.5658", "Content Unit": "1(5), 3(5), 4(4), 9(4), 10(3), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 27(2), 29(2), 32(2), 38(1), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 56(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

I used a height of 4.53 meters. You have to make sure that the car has enough energy to reach the ends safely. The higher the drop is, the more energy it will have in total. There are 2 different types of energy, potential energy (pe) and kinetic energy (ke). Pe is the energy that is stored in an object when it is staying still. Ke is the energy that is released when the object is in motion. The amount of pe at the top of my hill was 2215 joules, and my ke was 0 joules. At the bottom of the hill, the energy switched. The pe was 0 joules, and the ke was 2214 joules. Now when you add a hill, the hill needs to be smaller than the drop itself. The pe at the top of the hill must be lower than the pe at the top of the drop. If you want to add more hills, you must make sure each hill is smaller than the hill before it. There is also the mass of the car. The mass must be between 40 and 60, or it will not make it to the end. The heavier the car, the more energy it will have. I would also recommend that they do not make the height so tall that the speed is more than 8.4 m/s, or else people will get hurt. The higher the drop is, the more speed that the roller coaster will have throughout the ride. The recommended speed would be around 6.7 m/s. With the initial drop being 5 m, the speed will be up to 9.88, which is too fast. A height of 4.53 m would have a speed of 9.41 m/s, which is still too fast. A height of 2.91 m will have a speed of 7.55 m/s. This is a good speed.

I would also recommend a higher mass car for the roller coaster as well (it makes it go faster than it would regularly be) but not to much more than the regular 50. I would not recommend a lower starting point or car mass because, with   the starting point being lower it wouldn't make it even half way up that hill before it went backwards. for example in Add a hill for my second trial i set my starting point at 5m and my hill height at 5m it did not make it to the end even thought it had over 2000 Jules of potential energy. My first trial i did 4m for the starting point and for the hill height I set it to 3.50m it made it to the end with much to spare. for my third trial i did something similar, I did 5m for my starting height and 2.50 for my hill height it made it to the end. My last trial had over 2000 Jules nad it made a difference when the hill height was not as big as the starting point. The higher the Hill the more power/ speed it has behind it for example, my trial #1 in Drop Height and speed the intial drop height was 5m at the bottom of the hill the speed was 9.86 and the speed at the end of the ride was 9.87. while in my trial #4 the intial drop height was 3m and the speed at the bottom of the hill was 7.64 and at the end it was 7.64. This proves that the higher the drop height the more speed/power it will gather on the way down the track and how fast it will be for the duration of the ride. In theory you would want hills and inversions to have the car continue down the track at increasing speeds. with the mass of the car involved you would think that the more mass it would have the faster it would go. this is not true, in my trial #2 i put the cars mass at 50kg the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.27 and the speed at the end of the trial was 8.27 as well. while in my Trial #3 i had the cars' mass at 60kg and the speed at the bottom of the drop 8.27 and at the end of the trial the speed was 8.27. But wait theres more, in my trial #5 the cars mass was set to 45kg and the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.27 while at the neding it was also 8.27. so you can take any weight in the car and it will be the same although you need to make sure that it stays withing the fun and safe zome of speed for these kinds of rides so this is just below the safe zone.

The height that we decided on was 3 meters which 1709 J of KE at the top of the hill, if we went with a hill height of 5 meters, there is not nearly enought KE at the top of the hill to make it over.  we had to research how much the car shoudl weigh.

The higher the initial drop the greater amount of total energy, PE, and KE. This makes the coaster faster. We have also concluded that if you want a hill in your ride it needs to be a shorter height than your initial drop. As a team, we have decided that the mass of the car affects does not affect the speed of the roller coaster. \n     In the initial drop experiment, we examined that when the height of the drop was taller it would have more potential energy. When the height of the drop is smaller it will have less potential energy. In my data, if the height of the drop at the top was 5 meters, it had 1955 joules of potential energy. If the height at the drop at the top is 2 meters it would have 782 joules of potential energy. This shows that the initial drop should be a tall height.\n     We learned about the relationship between PE and KE, and have concluded this; the amount of potential energy at the top of the drop will be the same as the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop. If the height of the drop is taller it will have more than if the drop was smaller. For example for trial 1 the PE at the top was 1955 joules, the KE at the bottom is supposed to be 1955 joules, therefore the PE at the top is the same as the KE at the bottom.  Also at the drop height of 5, the PE was 1955 joules, which was greater than the drop height of 3.75 with the energy of 782 joules. The KE is also greater with the height. The less potential energy of the car going down, the more kinetic energy towards the bottom.\n     The Law Of Conservation Of Energy is very important when building a roller coaster. The law of conservation is that âEnergy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can convert from one type of energy to anotherâ. The PE can transform into the KE, but it cannot be destroyed. The PE, for example, was 2445 joules for trial one, and for the KE at the top of the hill was 2445 joules, therefore the PE turned into KE and KE can turn into PE.\n     We have also discovered that the amount of potential energy is the same as the total energy at the end. For example in the initial drop experiment, trial 2 the PE was 782 joules, and the total energy was 782 joules. For many more trials, this stayed true.\n     The Kinetic energy of an object with less speed and higher mass could be the same. KE = 1/2 mv2 is the equation for Kinetic Energy. Kinetic energy is dependent on the mass, which means that as an object's mass increases, so does it's Kinetic Energy. This is shown through the mass and energy experiment. For trial 4,  the mass was the greatest for that experiment and the mass was 60. The KE was 2932 joules, trial 4 has the most KE. This clearly shows that the KE changes when the mass changes. The greater the mass the more KE.\n   In our drop height and speed, these were our findings. The higher the initial drop the greater amount of speed at the bottom of the drop. At the bottoms of hills, roller coaster cars always travel the fastest. This is similar to the first idea in that at the bottom of hills, all potential energy has been transformed into kinetic energy, resulting in increased speed. For example, on trial one we have the initial drop height at 5, and the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.89 m/s. The third trial had the shortest initial drop height, with a speed at the bottom of the drop of 8.06. This clearly shows that the higher the initial drop the more speed it will have at the bottom of the drop because trial 1 had a greater speed than trial three because of the initial drop height.  With the drop height at 3.5, the roller coaster was at an enjoyable,e speed and safe speed of 8.27. The 5th trial worked. We also realized Gravity takes over as you start traveling down that first slope, and all of your potential energy transforms into kinetic energy. The cars are constantly pushed downward by gravity. The coaster tracks transfer this power and control the direction in which the coaster cars drop. Gravity pulls the front of the car toward the ground as the rails slant down, causing it to speed. When the tracks tilt-up, gravity puts a downward pull on the coaster's back, causing it to slow down. The coaster will keep a forward speed even when traveling up the track, against the pull of gravity, because an item in motion tends to stay in motion (Newton's first law of motion). The coaster's kinetic energy is converted to potential energy as it moves up one of the minor hills that follow the original roller coaster. The track's route is constantly transferring energy from kinetic to potential and back again in this way.\n      In our final experiment mass and speed, we came to the conclusion that The mass of the object does not change the speed. For example, using trial one the mass was 40kg and the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.27m/s. For trial 4 the mass of the car was 60kg and the speed at the bottom was 8.27 m/s. This clearly shows that the mass of the car doesn't change the speed of the car at the bottom of the drop or even at the end of the ride. The speed at the end of the ride was the same as the speed at the bottom of the drop. \n      After all of our trials and experiments, we have realized that there are many things that go into a roller coaster and it is more complex than you think. You also have to make sure the coaster is at a fun and enjoyable speed but also safe. We definitely learned a lot and can wait to see the new roller coaster design. \n\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "85", "Raw": "79", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.5940", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.9060", "Comprehensive": "0.7500", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 7(4), 8(4), 9(4), 10(3), 11(3), 14(3), 15(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 30(2), 35(2), 37(1), 39(1), 40(1), 42(1), 43(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

So for our initial drop, we have decided to go with 3.5 meters high. Because if we had it any higher than it would have been too fast for the limit that you had for the speed and if it was any shorter it would have been a bit too slow for the lower limit so we wanted to max out our limit to make the ride more fun. The Potential Energy at the top of the ride was 1576 Joules and at the bottom, it was 0. The Kinetic Energy at the top was 0 and at the bottom, it was 1576 Joules. So when the car went down the hill PE decreased and KE increased Overall the Total energy was 1576 Joules.\n \nFor the hill, we have decided to go 2.5 meters high. Because if we had it any higher than the initial drop then it wouldn't make it to the end because the start doesn't have enough energy to make it over the hill and if we had it really small then it would be very dangerous because you not slowing down on a hill so it would get really fast. So when the car went up the hill The PE increased and the KE decreased back to how it was at the start and it just keeps doing that. So when the car goes down the PE decreases and KE increases and when the car goes up the PE increases and KE decreases.\n\nFinally, for our car mass, we went with 46. Because we didn't want to go too high with the mass and we didn't want the minimum either. So the mass can affect energy according to the data for mass and energy the higher the mass the higher the energy. For example when the mass was 40 the energy was1273 and when the mass was 46 the energy changed to 1464. mass and energy  So mass and speed the data showed that the mass never affects the speed no matter how high or low the speed is mass never changes it. An example of this one is in the mass and speed part when the mass was 40 and the speed was 8.84 and when the mass was 54 the speed was still 8.84.

Using my data, when I put the ID height as around 3.25m, It would have a better result. Any ID height lower than 3.25m would have lower PE at the initial height, and a lower KE at the bottom of the initial drop, with also less excitement. By having 3.25m, you will have a lot of PE and KE going down the hill.  If it was lower than 3.25m, the roller coaster car might not even make it to the end. Having the ID height higher than 3.25m, you would have a lot more energy and speed, which could have a bad outcome, and the ride wouldn't be safe at all. When you're putting your hill height, it needs to be lower than the initial drop, or your roller coaster car is not going to get over the hill, and it'd be a total flop. If you put the hill height too low, there wouldn't be much excitement on the ride with a small hill. Your hill height should be around 4m or a little less. Having 4m as your hill height makes it so it's lower than the initial drop, but not that low so it wouldn't lose people's attention.

When finding the best options that fit all of your requirements I found that a smart option for the initial drop height would be 3.25 m. I have chosen this number for an ideal initial drop height because I found that going any higher would increase the PE at the top which turns into KE or motion and the higher the motion the higher the speed and the more speed means more speed at the end of the ride and a higher ID height makes the number closer to the max speed which just increases the possibility of complications and/or introduces risks I also found that going any lower doesn't introduce any risks but instead just makes the ride less enjoyable. When looking over the trials for my hill height I found that the smartest option would be 2.25 m I believe this because In testing out options for the height of the ID and Hill that 3.25 and 2.25 m would be the best options because it makes the speed at the end of the ride at a good in-between the max and the least the speed at the end of the ride can be.\nFor the mass of the car I have chosen 50 I chose this because I noticed that the mass of the car doesn't affect the speed just increases the possibility of complications so I picked 50m because it was in the exact middle. The PE at the top relates to the KE at the bottom because at all times during the ride PE+KE=TE so if KE is 100 and PE is 50 KE has to be 50 because 50+50=100. The height affects the PE and KE because the higher the drop the more PE at the top and because PE converts to KE at the bottom the height also affects the KE at the bottom in the same way. The law of conservation of energy states that the energy in the system, in the beginning, cannot change meaning my track will affect the total energy but my car mass will not.\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "19", "Raw": "12", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 71", "Quality": " 0.1690", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.1376", "Comprehensive": "0.1533", "Content Unit": "18(3), 27(2), 50(1), 52(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 59 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... but instead just makes the ride less enjoyable.\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... m.

I am excited to tell you I have found the final measurements and mass for this coaster.\n\n     I have found a great initial drop height, this I found to be 3.5 meters tall. This is a good height because in my test trials I have found that the higher the drop the more PE I will have. The more PE I have equals more KE. This is The Law of Conservation of Energy. This means that energy in a system can neither be created nor destroyed but can change forms. This height will benefit because there will be enough PE to ride through other obstacles. My data shows that when at the top of the drop the car will have 1710 J of PE. PE means the energy that can be used/turned into KE to go down the hill. KE is the energy that is used to go down the hill. KE and PE are never added or subtracted, they are just transferred between the two. As the car goes down the ID the PE is transferred into KE to make it down the hill. PE gets greater as the hill gets taller. \n\n     I have come up with a perfect hill height for the coaster. The hill height should be 3 meters tall. I chose this height because in my data I learned that if the hill height was equal to or taller than the ID wouldn't make it up the hill. My data shows that the car would make it to the top of the hill that was the same height but wouldn't make it over the hill. It would just roll back down. When the car went down the ID and the hill height was taller, the car didn't even make it to the top of the hill. Another thing is the hill has to be large enough that the car will still have PE to make it to the end of the track. The hill height can't be too tall to where it is unsafe because how much speed the car gains.\n\n     My data shows that the perfect mass for the car should be 60 kg. The mass of the car doesn't affect speed. I did 4 trials of mass and none of the speeds changed. The mass does affect the energy though, in my trials as I did 45 kg for mass and got total energy of 1744 J. When I did a mass of 60 for the car the total energy is 2347 J. This proves that when mass increases, the PE and KE increases along with it. PE and KE are related because they are just the 2 energy transferred between each other. This is also called the law of conservation of energy, as I stated farther up.\n\n     These are the final measurements and weights for the coaster, I am looking forward to starting to build soon.

So the ID will be 5.00 and the hill will be 2.00 and lastly, the mass will be 60. PE, KE, and TE will be really important. The relationship between mass and energy will be big they will be the exact same as all the others. The reason that the ID will be 5.00 is we need a lot of speed to get the car through the ride the hill is 2.00 because the ID must be smaller than the drop to make it over. The relationship between PE and KE is that PE is always super close to KE energy-wise the way that they will affect my ride is the PE will give me an estimate and the KE will match the PE. Going down the hill the KE and PE are going to be similar. The law of conservation is having enough energy to make it to the end of the ride. I need to have more than 1959 to make it to the end of the ride. The hill height must be lower than 5.00 to make it to the end of the ride. the mass of the car affects the ride the car mass must be heavy enough to carry the car to the end of the ride but not too big that you can't make it over the hill. So I would recommend that we have the hill height a 5.00 and the hill at 2.00. Hight affects Pe because the higher you are the more PE you have. Hight affects KE because the higher you are the more energy you will create. So we have designed a rollercoaster that is fun and safe. We have also learned that mass does not affect speed so really any mass that fits the criteria is fine. The height is also a key factor in this the height will affect the speed and PE & KE. The relationship between the mass of the car and energy is that the mass when you increase the mass it increases energy. Also when you increase the height you increase the speed because the more height the more time it has to make energy. We can not go higher because the system won't let us. We would not go low er because it will make the ride slower and less fun. So that is our roller coaster design. Height affects KE and PE by the higher the height is the higher the height the more PE it will have and pe is an estimate of how much KE it will have. Also the law of conservation at the end of the ride the tottle energy is going to be the same as the PE at the top of the height.

We believe that 3 would be perfect for the ID height because we found out that PE will increase along with the hill height, and the more PE the more KE we know this because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. When height changes so does PE and KE so when the height decrease or the cart moves down the track the energy doesn't just disappear it changes to KE. KE is just motion and motion = speed, also if PE/KE increases so does the total energy or stored up energy and out design leaves plenty of total energy to finish the ride. We know this is true because PE and KE stayed the same in our trials! Speed is a great fun factor but can also be dangerous so 3 gives a great range of speed 7.65 is what we found the speed would be, meaning it's right in the middle making it fast/fun, and safe, but we also need enough speed otherwise the car won't make it through the ride but 7.65 does make it without needing any help which is apart of your guy's criteria. While keeping this in mind we think the ideal Hill height would be 2.5 this is because we know the car can make it over because it's smaller than the ID drop and during our trials, we found that if it wasn't smaller it won't make it. Also, 2.5 leaves room for another hill to be added because we know it can only be smaller and 2 is the smallest we can go. We also believe 50kg would be a great mass for the car because the mass of the car doesn't affect the speed so we will be able to keep our speed for fun and not increase it to be unsafe or decrease it so it won't function. PE or speed as we've found is made of of mass and velocity, Mass so the mass of the car can affect the speed. So we need a good amount of mass to make sure we meet the requirements and our ride stays under the 8.4 and above the 6.7!\n\nThank you for choosing my company to design your roller coaster,\nâ¥ðð¸ð¶ð¹ðªð·ð ð·ðªð¶ð®â¥\n      ", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "31", "Raw": "32", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 96", "Quality": " 0.3333", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3670", "Comprehensive": "0.3502", "Content Unit": "3(5), 4(4), 10(3), 18(3), 19(3), 27(2), 35(2), 37(1), 44(1), 45(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 18 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: ....................

In my opinion, I think that you should make your initial drop height 3.50 I think that your initial drop height should be  3.50  because in my trial number one It shows evidence of my car being able to have enough energy to be able to make it through the whole entire course. Some examples of my research evidence are that in trial two my initial drop height was 3.50. I used a simulator so once I got the car onto the track I let my car go down the hill and then looked at the speed at the bottom of the initial drop. And the speed at the bottom of the drop was 2.65 so then after I found out what the speed was at the bottom of the drop that's height was 2.65  I then went on to look at the speed at the top of the hill. Once the car got to the top of the hill I stopped it to look at the speed the car got to and the top of the hill. Once I looked at the speed the can be going it said it was going  That meant that the speed from the initial drop was much faster than the speed at the top of the hill.\n\nAnother thing that I think you should consider is the hill height I think that your hill height should be high but not too high. For example, the heigh would be higher than the initial drop. That is too high because my recent studies show that if the initial drop was lower or smaller than the hill height then it would not be able to make it through the whole course. But once again if the hill height is smaller than the initial drop then it should be able to make it through the entire course because it has enough energy to make it up and over the hill.\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "24", "Raw": "20", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 82", "Quality": " 0.2439", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.2294", "Comprehensive": "0.2366", "Content Unit": "3(5), 10(3), 27(2), 32(2), 35(2), 40(1), 42(1), 50(1), 52(1), 57(1), 62(1)", "sentence 7 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 62 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "6278bd4430da3ae9a16a458b", "class_id": "4", "teacher_id": "GS", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "1)    Dear Gonzalez family, thank you for hiring our company to make your rollercoaster and make the needed designs.  I think you should have an ID height of 3.5 meters so you can maximize your potential energy so you have enough Kinetic energy to make it through the roller coaster.  If we have an ID of say 2 we wouldn't be able to have anything but the ID and it might not even make it to the end because it doesn't have enough potential energy stored to transfer into KE at the bottom of the ID.  In my first trial changing the ID, I had a height of  2.5 meters and had 1222J of PE at the top of my hill and that transferred into 1222J of KE but then say in my second trial I had an ID of 3 meters and my PE at the top was 1463J and at the bottom 1463J of KE which proves the higher the height is the more energy it has and we need lots of energy to make the car get to the end if we have hills, that leads into my statement in paragraph #2. Also, since my last essay, I have learned that height greatly affects the amount of m/s that the car has.  In I had ID heights ranging from 3 to 5 meters high and in the trials every time I increased the height of the ID the faster the car would be on the bottom of the ID, top of the hill, and at the end of the ride.                       \n \n\n2)                            I believe that we should have a hill height of 2 or 3 meters because the car will not make it to the end if I have a height of 4 meters as my ID and more than 3 meters of hill height.  My proof of this is when my Hill heights were 2 and 3 meters I had enough PE stored up from the ID to have enough KE to go over the hill.  But in my trials when I had a hill height of 4 and 5 meters my car didn't make it to the end because I didn't have enough energy to make it to the end because the hills were so tall.  This makes sense because the car doesn't have enough energy to make it up the same amount of distance the ID had and at 5 meters that would mean that the hill was higher than the ID so it would have far less energy stored up.  With the 5 meters the energy wouldn't be enough because it only had a little less than 4 meters of energy stored up and the 5 meters is one meter taller than 4 meters the hill would be higher and the car would fall down because it requires more than it had stored up.  Also, we can not create more PE so we can have enough KE to get up the hill and make it back down, the reason why we can't create more energy is that the Law of Conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, it only can be changed/converted into different forms.  One thing that is needed with the relationship between the ID and hill is that the ID needs to be higher than the hill because if the hill is higher than the ID there won't be enough PE because it takes too much energy to get up the hill than it has stored up, but we have the hill less than the ID we will have enough PE to transfer into KE to get up the hill.            \n\n3)                          Lastly, I think that we should have a car that has a weight of 52 kg because we needed a car that weighs enough to give us the needed energy but also is able to make it up the hill.  My reasoning for having the car 52 kg makes it balanced.  If we have a hill of 3 meters we might not be able to make it up if our car has 42 kg because it is so light and doesn't have the PE needed to make it up so it will just swoop down and just stop.  Also, if we have a car heavy like 60 kg we might have enough PE at the top of the ID and enough KE at the bottom of the ID our car might be so heavy with its weight and taking the fact that people from all shapes and sizes will be in it that the car might reach the very top of the hill but it will fall done because the mass is weighing the car down and the energy can't fight back. Finally, I am wanting a car with a 52kg because I know that mass affects the amount of PE that is transferred into KE, the heavier the car the more energy the object will hold.  Mass affects the PE and KE by gaining more energy from increasing the weight,  how mass affects energy is the more mass the more PE you have which is going to be the amount of transferred energy into KE.\n\n4) I am not going to go for a higher ID, Hill height, and car mass because I know that one, the mass will not affect the speed.  I know that because in my recent trials I had car masses from 40-60kg and every time the speed was the same.  I won't have a higher ID height because then I will have a speed that will be higher than the safety requirements.  I know this because in the trials I did I had my hill height set as 3m and I kept increasing my ID height to numbers like 4 which I had a speed of 8.84 m/s which exceeds the safety experiment. In my next trial, I had an ID height of 4.5m and once again it exceeded the safety requirements with a speed of  9.37 m/s.  I will not be increasing my hill heights because when I had my ID height at 3.5m and hill heights of 3m my speed was in the range of the requirements. But when I conducted a few trials where I increased the hill height and the car didn't make the safety requirements. In my first trial, I had a hill height of 3.5m my car couldn't make it up the hill.\n\n5) I am not going to decrease the ID, hill height, or mass because I know that it will not work.  First, I will not decrease the car's mass because mass doesn't affect the speed of the car.  Secondly, I will not be decreasing my ID height because in my trials I learned a few things.  In my first trial, I went to a drop height of 3m I had enough speed but my car didn't make it up the hill. Then in my second trial, I set my ID to 2.75 once again my car didn't make it up the hill.  With that evidence, I state my case that I won't be decreasing my ID because of those reasons.  Finally, I will not be decreasing my hill height because if I decrease it the ride might not be attractive and customers will not want to go on the ride and it will be a waste of money.  Technically I could decrease my hill height because in my trials when I decreased the hill height the car met the requirements and got past the hill but once again it would not peak the customers and would not be a good use of money building the rollercoaster and get nothing out of it.\n                                                                                  â¬ï¸Things to Know â¬ï¸\n6) One important thing to know while we make this is PE at the top of the ID will be the same amount of energy as KE at the bottom of the drop because the energy gets transferred.  Also as I have stated mass doesn't affect PE so our KE will not be affected because mass is not in the equations to calculate both. Finally, even though I have stated that I think ID should be higher than the hill because it will either exceed the speed requirements or it will not make it up the hill.  The reason that is because either we will have too much energy that it goes too fast and exceed our requirements and if we have a hill that has the same height we will barely miss the top of the hill due to not enough energy being stored up.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "81", "Raw": "62", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.4662", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7110", "Comprehensive": "0.5886", "Content Unit": "2(5), 4(4), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 14(3), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 25(2), 26(2), 27(2), 29(2), 31(2), 32(2), 35(2), 38(1), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 20 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... meters so you can maximize your potential energy so you have\n\t         .................... enough Kinetic energy to make it through the roller coaster.\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 60 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

I would put the ID (Initial drop) height to 4 because it will have enough energy for the whole ride and it would go around loops with still enough energy and it follows the safety requirements also if you had it at 5 it would probably slam into the bottom of the cart and it would go through loops fine but it would have too much energy. Also, it would probably not follow the safety requirements. I tried some different trails and I would pick a speed from 8.79 to 8.85. I would pick the speed of 8.80 because it has the higher speed at the top of the hill and the speed at the end of the ride would be 8.84. I did more than 4 more trials and the speed I would not pick is 8.85 because it has the lowest speed at the end of the ride even tho it is the biggest number of speeds I tried.

I will try to make a roller coaster with some of your wants. \n \nThis roller coaster must have these reqiurements: The speed must be under 8.4 m/s and above 6.7 m/s, the car must make it to the end of the ride, and it needs to have a initial drop and a hill.\n\nFirst, We should focus on the initial drop. I think the ID height should be 3.00m because it makes the ride fast but not too fast because that would be too dangerous for the people. The speed has to be under 8.4 m/s and at least above 6.7 m/s. The drop also can't be too low because it won't have enough PE to make it over the hill which means there will be enough KE to make it over the hill. We tested if this height would work and it did having a speed of 7.65 m/s.\n\nSecond, The hill height should be 2.50m high. It can't be the same height as the drop or higher because that will cause the car not to make it to the end of the ride. The PE at the top of the hill is 1223 and the KE at the top of the hill is 610. This is enough energy to make it to the end. So I think you should choose this for your hill height.\n\nLast, The mass of the car is the last thing to disscus. We decied that the mass should be 50 becuase it has a good amount of energy and not too much or too little. The PE at the top of the ID is 1467 and the KE at the bottom of the ID is 1465.\n\nI hope you choose carefully for this roller coaster.\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "29", "Raw": "29", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 92", "Quality": " 0.3152", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3326", "Comprehensive": "0.3239", "Content Unit": "3(5), 17(3), 18(3), 23(2), 26(2), 27(2), 32(2), 33(2), 35(2), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Our company knows we can make the best roller coater for your park. We recently did research on the initial drop and we found out the height of the initial drop should be 3.50 M. We know this because our research shows that the height of the initial drop affects the PE and the KE greatly. It affects PE at the top because the higher the object, the higher the PE (you need PE so it can change into KE). The law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can not be created nor destroyed, but it can change forms. When the car moves down the hill, the PE transforms into KE. This is shown in the trials because the hill height was 2.50 M and the PE at the top was 1222 J and the KE was zero. At the bottom of the hill, the PE was 0 J and the KE was 1222 J. In my second trial, the hill height was 3.00 and the PE at the top of the hill was 1466 J and the KE was 0 J. At the bottom of the hill, the PE was 0 J and the KE was 1466 J.  The height could be lower, but we would recommend against it because it would be less fun. We would also recommend against any higher height because there \nwould be too much energy.\n \nThe hill height should be lower than the initial drop height, but the perfect height would b 3 M. I know this because the hill height was 2.01 M in my first trial and the car made it over. But in my second trial, the height was 4.00 M and the car did not make it over. This happens because there is not enough KE and PE to make it over. \n\nThe mass of the car should be 56 KG so the ride is safe. The relationship between mass & PE is the more mass the car has, the higher the PE. I know this because in my first trial, the mass of the car was 40 kg & the PE was 1564 J. In my second trial, the mass of the car was 48 kg & the PE was 1876 J. In my third trial, the mass of the car was 60 kg & the PE was 2346 J. The relationship between mass & KE is the more mass the car has, the higher the KE. I know this because in my first trial, the mass of the car was 40 kg & the KE was 1564 J. In my second trial, the mass of the car was 48 kg & the KE was 1876 J. In my third trial. the mass of the car was 56 kg & the KE was 2346 J. The mass of the car has no bearing on speed because the energy did not change.  But we also know that mass affects PE (the higher the mass, the more PE.) \n\nIn conclusion, the ID height should be 3.50 M, the hill height should be 3.00 M, & the mass of the car should be 56 KG.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "43", "Raw": "38", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 113", "Quality": " 0.3363", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4358", "Comprehensive": "0.3860", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 11(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 27(2), 35(2), 40(1), 43(1), 46(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Having enough PE make the car go faster and reach the end, what happens to PE and Ke and the total energy is that it transfers. The relationship between the id height and hill height is that the more height the hill has the farther the car goes. PE and KE,Total energy makes the car's ability of speed to make it through the ride. Height increases the speed of the car (6.7m/s) to reach the safety requirements.

In our first trial, the height was 2.5m, and the PE was 1222 J. In the second trial, the height was 3.5m, and the PE was 1710 J, which is what we think you should choose. In the third trial height was the height was 4.25m, and the PE was 2077J. In the fourth trial, the height was 5m, and the PE was 2443J, but these last two options may be too dangerous. We believe that you should not go over 3.5m because the car may go too fast and something could happen to the car and its passengers. The speed of 8.27m/s meets the requirements, this is the speed of 3.50 for ID height. The car mass should be 58kg, the reason we chose it was because we actually did not notice the car mass affecting speed, so we just chose this mass. In the first trial, the mass was 50kg, and the speed was 6.99m/s. in the second trial, the mass was 60kg, and the speed was 6.99m/s. In the third trial, the mass was 40kg, and yet again, the speed was 6.99m/s\n\n      We noticed that the greater the mass of the car is, the greater the PE at the top of the initial drop. In our first trial, the car mass was 40kg, and the PE at the top of the ID was 1564J. In the second trial, the mass was 50kg, and the PE was 1955J. In the third trial, the mass was 55kg, and the PE was 2142J. In the third trial, the mass was 60kg and the PE at the top of the ID was 2346J. We also noticed that as the car goes down the ID, the PE at the top drains and the KE at the bottom grows, and the numbers always equal what the PE at the top was as it goes down, let's use the data of the first trial. At the top of the ID, the PE was 1222J, the KE was 0J, and at the bottom of the ID, the PE was 0J, and the KE was 1222J, as the car went down, PE was being subtracted and KE was being added, but the entire way down, the total number of Joules will always be what the PE was at the top and what the KE was at the bottom, in this trial it was 1222J.\n\n      In our trials, it shows that we need more PE at the top of the drop than at the top of the hill for the car to make it over. In our first trial, the PE at the top of the ID was 1956J,  and the PE at the top of the hill was 982J, the car made it over. In the second trial, the ID PE was 1958J, and the hill PE was 1470J, the car made it over. In the third trial though, the ID PE was 1961J, the hill PE was also 1961J, and the car didn't make it over the hill. We also noticed that the higher the car mass, the higher the PE at the top of the hill. In our first trial, the car mass was 40kg, and the PE at the top of the ID was 1564J. Second trial: the car mass was 50, and the PE was 1955. Third trial: the mass was 55, and the PE was 2142.\n\n      The hill height should be 3.25m because if we go over, the car will not make it over, in the first trial, the hill height was 3.25m, and it made it over, this is what you will be using. In the second trial, the hill height was 3.50m, (same height as the ID) and it did not go over.

I claim that 3.61 meters are the best height for the ID because if it is too low it will not be fun and if it is too high it will not be safe. I think this because the higher the ID is the more energy in the car to get it across the whole track because in my first test which was 2.5m and at the top of the ID the PE was 1222 and it all changed to KE when it got to the bottom and the total energy was the same at 1222 the whole time and in my 3rd test my hight was 4m the PE at the top was 1955 and at the bottom, the PE all became KE but the total energy was the same the whole time so that show that the higher the ID is the more energy the car has. That is why I think 3.61 is the best height with the PE at the top of the drop being 1764 and the KE at the bottom of the drop being 1764 it is the perfect amount of energy the people's enjoyment and for them to stay safe.\n\n           I think that the hill should be 3 m tall because the hill has to be lower than the ID so the is enough energy to make it over the hill. I know this in my first test my hill height was 2 and it made over just fine but the PE did not rebuild enough to make it exciting. In my 2ed hill was 3m and the PE rebuild up so we could pick up speed and it made it over the hill just right and we can't go higher because in my 3ed and 4th one was the same height as the ID and one was more than the ID and the car did not make it over because the law of conservation of energy states that the energy can not be created or destroyed but can change forms this show that all the PE at the top of the drop the changes to KE at the bottom and then when you go up the hill the energy goes back to PE and there will be no KE and you need KE to move up the hill so when the hill is to bing to will not be enough KE to get over the hill so it will go back down the hill the wrong way. So if it is not taller than 3.61 it will not make it over so that means that 3 is the best height to use here. \n\n           I think the car mass should be 50kg because if there is too much weight and will go too fast and will be dangerous and will have too much energy off the drop and if it is too light there will not be as much energy and will not be fun for the people riding and will not bring more people so I pick the one in the middle witch the best amount to get to the end of the ride and the people will have fun and be safe the whole ride and it will bring more people to your park. \n\nFrom, \n    Kinley and the rest of the team\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "34", "Raw": "31", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 102", "Quality": " 0.3039", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3555", "Comprehensive": "0.3297", "Content Unit": "6(4), 12(3), 18(3), 27(2), 28(2), 29(2), 32(2), 33(2), 34(2), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 47(1), 52(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 52 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... if it is too high it will not be safe\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 18 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... meters are the best height for the ID and.\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 2": "Content Unit: 28 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... because if it is too low it will not be fun\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 40 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

When you go down the hill. The car Mass is 50kg, which means we're in between 40kg and 60kg. The car Mass doesn't actually affect the speed at all, it stays the same and doesn't change. The speed at the bottom of the drop is 7.66 m/s, which means we're going fast but not over the speed limit. The Speed at the top of the hill is 4.42 m/s which means they slow down for a couple of seconds, once you start going down the hill again, you start speeding up again. The Speed at the bottom/End of the ride is 7.66 m/s. You're still going fast not over the speed limit so it means it is safe to ride on and hope no one will get hurt or injured, we're also not going too slow either. You know you're going too slow if your speed is either equal to or under 6.7 m/s, but we're going in between the speed limits.\n\nThe PE at the top of the hill is 1466 (J). And we're not moving at all. When we go down the hill, the PE is decreasing and KE is increasing. When we're going up the hill, the PE is increasing and the KE is decreasing. Once we hit the end of the roller coaster, there is no PE but there's 1466 (J) of KE. The total Energy is 1466 (J). If we changed the height of the ID the PE and KE would be different. EX: We set are ID to 4 and the PE is 1964 (J). This means that once we get to the end of the ride the total energy is gonna be 1964 (J). \n\nThe criteria of hill height is that it needs to be lower than the ID or the car won't make it to the end of the ride. You have to have enough PE to make it to the end of the ride because if you don't your gonna get stuck at one point which will make the ride boring and no one will want to come again. So you need to have enough PE to make it to the end. The criteria for the hill height is it needs to be lower than the Initial drop (ID) or else you'll get stuck in between. For example, if the ID is 4m and the hill height is 5m it's not gonna make it, but if the ID was 4m and the hill height is 3m you'll make it over easy.\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "40", "Raw": "34", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 110", "Quality": " 0.3091", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3899", "Comprehensive": "0.3495", "Content Unit": "3(5), 10(3), 17(3), 18(3), 18(3), 20(2), 24(2), 27(2), 33(2), 35(2), 37(1), 42(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 62 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

This is because the car will have the most PE (which transfers to KE as the car moves downhill) and therefore the most total energy while still being safe. This was proved in my trials. In the first one, the drop height was 2.5 and the PE was 1222J while the speed was 6.99 m/s. In trial two the drop height was 3.5m and the PE was 1712J and the speed was 8.27 m/s. In my last trial, the ID was maxed at 5m and the PE was 2443J while the speed was 9.88 m/s. Thus 5m would have the most total energy but goes over the speed limit of 8.4 m/s. Trial one at 2.5 could have worked (as it's above the excitement requirement of 6.7 m/s) but isn't as exciting as trial two. The law of Conservation Of Energy states that: \"energy can not be created nor destroyed, it can only change form\". This means that the PE that we start with will be the amount of energy we will have for the entire coaster, including the KE and we want the most total energy we can get while still being safe so, 3.5m is the best option.\n\nThe hill height of the best roller coaster would be 3m.  This is because you will be able to make it over it, while still having fun. This was shown in my trials where the ID height was consistently 3.5. In trial one, the HH (hill height) was 2 and it made it to the end. In trial two, the HH was 3 and it made it to the end. In my last trial, the HH was 5 and sadly it didn't make it to the end. This is because the ID has to be taller than the HH to have the energy to make it over. Like I said before, energy can't be created nor destroyed, so the amount we start with will be the amount we have for the whole ride. 3m is just about the extent of a safe and fun ride, so it's our best bet. \n\nThe car mass of my roller coaster would be 50kg. This is because it would provide a nice, smooth ride. I noticed throughout my trials that while the mass affected the PE it didn't relate to speed at all. Testing from a mass of 40kg-60kg the total energy increased from 1371J-2056J but the speed always maxed at 8.27 m/s. This proves that mass doesn't affect the ride at all, so 50kg is a nice, middle number!

My hill height is going to be 2m because if you did a bigger number the car will not go up the hill and just go back down and not be able to go up the hill.  The car was going to be 47Kg because the car when passed everything and didn't stop and why I did make it to 60kg is because it wouldn't be nice for the track. And with all my data it will make it to the bottom. the total energy would be 1962. when the car moves down the hill PE and KE will change and make the total energy. for trial one the hill was PE 982 and for KE it was 974 and the total energy was  1958 for trial two the hill was PE 1471 and for KE it was 486the total energy was 1558 for trial 3 the hill for PE it was 1959 for KE it was the total energy was 1959. My first piece of evidence is that if you put 5m for your DI height and put your hill 2m and put your car mass 60 it would work. for trial two my piece of evidence is that I used my data and I tried it and it works for trial three my piece of evidence is if you make the hill bigger than the ID height will not work. you cant have a hill bigger than the ID because the car can go up it. And so it will make the and it's not too fast. And if the PE  at the top will get bigger and the KE will too. If your speed is at the bottom of the drop and if it's not the same as the speed at the end of the ride it's not going to do what you want it to do like move and go up the hill. How does height affect PE and KE object will be higher if the object is placed at a greater height. For PE Tripoli the height will result in a double the gravity for PE. \n\nthanks for reading \n\n- Ava Swenson Stevenson\n\n\n\n \n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "31", "Raw": "30", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 96", "Quality": " 0.3125", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3440", "Comprehensive": "0.3283", "Content Unit": "3(5), 10(3), 18(3), 20(2), 26(2), 27(2), 32(2), 35(2), 37(1), 39(1), 40(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 52(1), 55(1), 56(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 52 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... the hill will be smaller because of the speed safety requirement\n\t", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 3": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... because if you go with a bigger number its going to go faster and\n\t         ....................

For starters, the initial drop must be higher than everything else on the roller coaster. If anything is higher, the roller coaster wonât have enough energy to make it past any of the hills. So that means nothing can be taller or the same height as the initial drop. The best height for the initial drop would most likely be 3.5m. We chose this height because we will get 1710J of PE and we will get a good amount of stored energy to make it past the hills since PE converts to KE. This happens because the higher the ID, the more PE, and when the car is in motion and starts rolling down the ID, the PE converts to KE. I also chose this height because it is safe but still goes very fast. We donât want to make it any higher because it will be dangerous and go too fast. Also, the PE converts to KE while it moves down the track and KE gives the roller coaster speed so this ride will be quite exciting. Another reason we chose this height is because of the speed. The fastest speed that will still be safe is 8.4 because anything higher is unsafe. That is why we chose this height because this height's speed is 8.27 and that is under the limit.\n\nThe Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but can be converted to different types of energy. This proves my point that PE can convert into KE. Also, this means that no matter what, the roller coaster won't get more energy than it started with. The Law of Conservation of Energy also states that in a closed system, total energy will always stay the same. This is why the ride won't get more energy than it started with because the total energy is all the types of energy on the ride, summed up. This is why nothing can be taller or the same height as the initial drop. Because if anything is taller, it requires more energy than there is.\n\nLike I said before, nothing can be taller or the same height as the ID, so the hills can't be taller or the same height as the ID. Our criteria for the hill height should be 3.25m because it is shorter than the ID. Now, if you want more than 1 hill in the ride, here's what you're going to have to do. You have to make each hill smaller than the first hill. For example, the first hill is 3.25m, the second hill will best have to be 3.00m, and so on. This is because while the car is going down the ID, PE converts to KE which is speed, and when it goes up the hill, it converts some KE into PE because you are going up.  You gain PE when you lose speed and are higher up. So your KE turns to PE and you slow down when you go up the hill. So you may want to have a drop before your next hill so you can gain speed and convert the PE back to KE.\n\nThe last thing I have to add is that the more mass the car has, the more PE, KE, and total energy. This is good because it gives you more energy and a higher chance of completing the entire coaster. So the best mass for the car should be 50 because on the hills if the car has too much mass, it could affect the chances of the car going up the hills. I won't make the mass any lower because it won't have any extra PE so there would be no point in having less mass. This amount of mass is good because it gives a good amount of PE and of course, it converts to KE. We don't want to go any less than this because it would give us less energy and lower chances of making it through the entire ride.\n\nUsing this information tells you that we are the best company to build your coaster because we have all of the information and data to make the best roller coaster ever.\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "57", "Raw": "53", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 127", "Quality": " 0.4173", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6078", "Comprehensive": "0.5126", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 10(3), 11(3), 17(3), 18(3), 23(2), 25(2), 27(2), 29(2), 31(2), 32(2), 33(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 38(1), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 23 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

The potential energy should have 1000 at the top of the roller coaster because it is the same amount of joules as it should have. \nWhen the car gets to the end of the roller coaster the 1000 joules that were in the potential energy should have transferred to the kinetic energy when it gets to the end of the ride because the number of joules should always stay the same so all of the joules transfer to the kinetic energy at the end. \nThe height affects the potential energy and the kinetic energy because the higher the car is then the more potential energy at the beginning and kinetic energy at the end of the roller coaster. So the initial drop height should be high enough to get it over the hill that is coming next but not too much so that it goes too fast and get dangerous. The reason the height is set at is a certain height that is between 2m-5m as an example number because if the height is any lower than 2m then the car would not be able to get over another hill if it was not smaller than the initial drop. If the initial drop was higher than 5m then the car would have too much power and would be going too fast.\n\nThe potential energy and the kinetic energy affect each other because when the car starts to go down the energy starts to transfer from potential energy to kinetic energy but no matter how high or low the initial drop is the number of joules will always stay equal to the number of joules that you start with.\nThe Potential energy starts to shift when it gets to the bottom of the hill and will change from 5m to 0 when it gets to the bottom of the hill because the energy will be traveling to kinetic energy. By the end of the ride, the kinetic energy should have all of the joules. \nThe law of conservation shows that when the energy is transferred the number always stays the number of joules that is set when the car is at the top of the initial drop because when the car drops the potential energy goes down to 0 and the kinetic energy starts to go up and has all of the joules. The ride will make it to the end because the number of potential energy is the number of joules that it will always be and it will not go up or down when the potential energy gets transferred to kinetic energy.\n\nThe initial drop height has to be bigger than the next hill because when the initial drop is smaller than the hill that will come next then you will not have enough energy because we won't be using anything to help it get over. The energy is the only thing that will make it get over the hill after the initial drop. \nThe hill has to be smaller and if you want more than 1 hill the hills will have to get progressively smaller because by the end of the ride the energy should have made it through all of the hills. The height of the roller coaster that it is set at will affect the potential energy and kinetic energy because when the car starts at the top of the hill the number of joules at the top of the hill will be in the potential energy but when the car travels down the hill then the height will have to be laid out of much energy that will be transferred the kinetic energy when the car is traveling down the hill. \n\nThe mass of the car will affect the ride because if the car is too heavy then the car will not make it over an of the hills that the ride will have. The number of the potential energy and the kinetic energy and the total amount of energy contribute to the mass of the car so that the car gets over \nall of the hills. The mass of the car can't be so heavy that it can't get over a small hill so it should be between 40-60 kg for an example number. If the car was under 40 kg then the car wouldn't be heavy enough for the car to get through the whole ride safely. If the car was over 60 kg then the car would be too heavy for the car the get through the whole ride without having to make the car lighter so that it can make it through the ride.

We've shared a progress report prior to this, but we believe that we have nearly completed our research in building the perfect rollercoaster for you. You may also notice similarities in both letters, as some research didn't change throughout our progress. \n\nTo begin, the height of the initial drop has been changed. In our progress report from before, we planned for the initial drop to be 4.5 meters high. However, we found that, in order for the roller coaster to be safe for riders, it needs to follow the safety requirement of the speed being 8.4 meters per second (m/s) and having an initial drop of 4.5 meters, unfortunately, didn't follow that. In fact, even just 4.25 meters had a speed of 9.09 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop. \nSo, we have changed the height of the initial drop to 3.5 meters high. The speed is still fun for riders, but is safer and only follows a speed of 8.27 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop. We still wanted to coaster to be fun and thrilling for riders, so we didn't want the speed to be less than 6.7 m/s. \nIn some of our research, we found that the higher the initial drop height was, the more energy there would be to make it through the rest of the coaster. In one experiment, when the height was 4.25 meters high, there were 2077 Joules of potential energy (PE) at the top of the initial drop and 2077 Joules of kinetic energy (KE) at the bottom of the initial drop. This is enough energy to make it through the roller coaster, but increasing the height increases the total energy as well. In an experiment when the release height (Initial drop height) was 5.0 meters high, there were 2443 Joules of energy at the beginning and end of the coaster, just in different forms of energy. The potential energy at the top and kinetic energy at the bottom are related because of the Law of Conservation of Energy.\n\nThe Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed, but it can be transferred to other objects within the source. As I said, this is related to potential and kinetic energy. With no friction, the energy transfers from potential to kinetic energy at the beginning and end of the rollercoaster. Potential energy is the amount of energy that an object stores and kinetic energy is the energy that an object has because it's in motion. So in theory, if there's no friction the amount of potential energy at the beginning of the rollercoaster, will be the same amount of energy (counted in Joules) of kinetic energy at the end of the rollercoaster, or at the very least the initial drop. The total amount of energy also remains the same. In all of our research on the initial drop, the total amount of energy is always the same while it is transferred. In an experiment where the total amount of energy was 1466 Joules, all potential energy at the top of the initial drop, at the bottom of the drop, all of the energy was kinetic. Similar results were the same throughout all of our experiments. \n\nIn addition, the hill height of the coaster shall be 2.25 meters. We changed it slightly, to abide by the new initial drop height, but it's still a fun experience for riders. Our research didn't change much for this, but we did find that it should be this height in order for it to be smaller than the initial drop. Extensive research has shown that the hill has to be smaller than the initial drop, not any larger or even the same size. In a trial where the height of the initial drop was 4.0 meters and the height of the hill was 4.0 meters, the total energy was 1959 Joules, but the car failed to make it over the hill and just fell backward. Anything higher did the same. When the hill height was 5.0 meters with a slightly higher potential energy of 1961 Joules, the car still failed to make it to the end of the ride. However, anything lower worked fine. In one experiment, a 3.0-meter hill height trial, the total amount of energy was 1956 Joules and the car made it easily over the hill. We could adjust this to your convenience, but I think that 2.25 meters would be the best height in accordance with the initial drop.\nAnything lower than the height of the initial drop would work (3.5 meters), so I'm sure even 3.4 meters would work as well. But I think that 2.5 meters will still make it a thrilling experience and will move smoothly and fast on the rollercoaster. \n\nFinally, I think that the mass of the car should be 50 kilograms. It was originally 55 kilograms, but it doesn't particularly matter. In our most recent research, we found that the mass of the car doesn't affect the speed of the rollercoaster at all. In an experiment when the mass of the car was 40 kilograms, the speed at the bottom of the drop and the end of the ride (the times when the speed is the highest), the speed was 8.25 m/s. Compare this to the trial when the mass of the car was 60 kilograms, and the speed was 8.27. In all five of our trials, we found that the speed at these points of the rollercoaster was within 2 m/s. In 3 out of 5 of the trials the meters per second were, 8.27 and the other 2 trials were within the same range. So, we chose 50 kilograms for the weight of the car because it's a nice middling point for the weight, but it really doesn't affect the speed, energy, or any other major variables throughout the rollercoaster. \n\nAnd that is all I have for our rollercoaster report. If you have any suggestions or concerns please let us know. We appreciate you for choosing our engineering company to make your rollercoaster. And we are confident that our design will be the perfect rollercoaster for you.\n\nSincerely, \nGracie Beyer\n\nSenior Engineer\nPresident of Gracie's Engineering Company", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "85", "Raw": "63", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.4737", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7225", "Comprehensive": "0.5981", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 10(3), 11(3), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 20(2), 22(2), 23(2), 25(2), 27(2), 28(2), 29(2), 32(2), 34(2), 42(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 6 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 15 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... meters high.\n\t", "sentence 7 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 23 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

For the roller coaster, we need the initial drop to be 4 meters high. Therefore it's not too high and it's not too low because if it was too low you couldn't get over the hill. And we know from our trials that if the Hill height is more than the initial drop height then the cart won't get over the drop. The data states that when the initial drop for meters We got the best results. And when the cart is going down the initial drop the KE increases while the PE decreases.\n\nBut with the hill, we need the height to be 2.75 so it's not higher than the initial drop so the card can get over the hill therefore we make it to the end of the track. We know that we need to highlight the 2.75 because in the trials it had the best results Working with the initial drop because if it's too high then the cart won't make it up the initial drop and if it's too low we won't be able to add anything else like a loop or something like that.\n\nFor the mass of our cart we need it to be 46 Kg. Therefore, it's not too light and it's not too heavy because if it was too heavy we wouldn't make it up the hill and if it was too light it wouldn't have enough energy. But when we go to a higher Mass like 60 when you get higher total energy the end is Just Energy in general. and when the mass is lower we get less energy.\n\n\nAnd add on to our height we need it to be 4 because The height affects the speed Because if it was too high it wouldn't be a super fun ride it would be more Of A Thrill Ride. And we can't have it too low because it won't go fast enough to make it up the hill so we need it sort of in the middle, not too high and not too low. And I know that because End the trials the mass doesn't affect the speed at all because every single time it's the same speed but different Mass. \n\nWe know that because in our data we had the best speed and hill highlight using 4 and 2.75. Because in our trials for wasn't to fast For The speed but if it was too low and wanted make it up the hill but if it was too tall It would have too much gravity and the ride would go to quick. and when we use to 2.75 it wasn't too high Because the cart wouldn't have  made it over the hill no. But if it was too low the ride would go way too quick and it wouldn't be as fun. \n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "27", "Raw": "26", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 88", "Quality": " 0.2955", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.2982", "Comprehensive": "0.2968", "Content Unit": "3(5), 16(3), 18(3), 27(2), 29(2), 32(2), 35(2), 40(1), 50(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1)", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 3 [Weight: 5]\n\tSegment: .................... if the Hill height is more than the initial drop height\n\t", "sentence 6 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

But when I was at 4.5M the PE at the top of the initial drop was 2181J and KE at the bottom was 2181J which seems like a little too much and seems unnecessary because 2181J is too fast. Another reason I didn't go with 4.5m is that in my experiment I did 4m which is less than 4.5m and got a speed of 8.84m/s which is over the safety amount so I knew 4.5m would be too much so I went down to 3.5m and got 8.27 which is just below the safety requirement. And the reason I didn't go lower is because of the fun requirement if I went below 6.7 I would not be in the fun requirement and the ride would be boring.\n\nSince my initial drop height is going to be 3.5M I would do 3M for my hill height because it will go on top of the hill and slow down a bit before getting almost the same amount of PE as the initial drop giving me the amount of KE to make it through the rest of the roller coaster. And when the car moves down the hill the PE will turn into more KE and the law conservation of energy makes it have to stay to the total amount of Total energy because energy only cant be destroyed it can only change forms. And the total amount of energy stays the same so there will be around 1959J of PE and 222J of KE. the reason why I'm not adding more height is that if the hill height is 3.5m it will fall back when it reaches the top so it will not go past. but when the hill height is lower than the initial drop then the cart will always reach the end. Because in my add a hill experiment the initial drop height was 3M and the hill height was 3M and it did not reach the end.\n\nMy mass of the car will be 45KG because 60Kg would be too heavy and will generate too much energy and it will not be safe enough for your standards. Because in my data the mass of the cart was 60KG had 2639J of PE and 2639J of KE which when I saw went too fast for me and will be too dangerous but in the other piece of data, the mass was 45KG and had 2410J of PE and 2410J of KE which is enough for me and didn't go as fast as 60KG. So the higher the mass the higher the PE and KE. But since the mass does not affect speed witch I found that when the car's mass was 45kg it was 8.84 at the end of the hill and when it was 50kg it was 8.84m/s at the end of the ride. I won't go higher or lower because the mass does not affect speed and both my requirements are based on speed so I don't need to change it but it does affect the stored energy.\n\n\n\nThat is all we have for you today I hope you enjoyed this report ill see you sometime later.\n\n-The Institution of engineering.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "52", "Raw": "53", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 122", "Quality": " 0.4344", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6078", "Comprehensive": "0.5211", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 10(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 23(2), 27(2), 29(2), 31(2), 32(2), 33(2), 35(2), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 50(1), 52(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

I think that your initial drop height should be  4.1 because in my trial number one It shows evidence of my car being able to have enough energy to be able to make it through the whole entire course. Some examples of my research evidence are that in trial two my initial drop height was 4.1. I used a simulator so once I got the car onto the track I let my car go down the hill and then looked at the speed at the bottom of the initial drop. And the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.60 so then after I found out what the speed was at the bottom of the drop that's height was 4.1 I then went on to look at the speed at the top of the hill. Once the car got to the top of the hill I stopped it to look at the speed the car got to and the top of the hill. Once I looked at the speed the can was going it said it was going 4.63. That meant that the speed from the initial drop was much faster than the speed at the top of the hill. \n\nAnother thing that I think you should consider is the hill height I think that your hill height should be high but not too high. For example, the heigh would be higher than the initial drop. That is too high because my recent studies show that if the initial drop was lower or smaller than the hill height then it would not be able to make it through the whole course. But once again if the hill height is smaller than the initial drop then it should be able to make it through the entire course because it has enough energy to make it up and over the hill.\n\nNext, I think that the third thing that you should consider is the car mass I think that your car mass should be ", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "26", "Raw": "22", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 86", "Quality": " 0.2558", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.2523", "Comprehensive": "0.2541", "Content Unit": "3(5), 10(3), 18(3), 27(2), 32(2), 35(2), 40(1), 42(1), 50(1), 57(1), 62(1)", "sentence 7 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 62 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The first thing I would like to go through is the ID (initial drop) height, we have chosen 4.25 meters as the height for the ID and 3.00 for the hill height because of the potential energy (PE) at the top of the ID and hill height, the amount of PE is 2077 joules (J) and the hill height is 1596 (J) the potential energy is what determines if the car makes it through the course if you have too little then the car won't make it through, but if you have too much then the ride becomes unsafe. Another reason that we have chosen this height is that if we when any higher then the ride would not be safe because of the amount of PE and KE. But if we went any lower the ride would not be very fun and might not even make it to the end of the track. \nNow that we have discussed the potential energy and ID height let's now discuss the kinetic energy (KE). The KE is a force that happens when an object is in motion depending on the amount of PE then the amount of KE will also increase. for example, if the ID is 5.00 meters then the PE would be 2443 and the KE at the bottom of the drop would be 2443 as well. The reason that the energy is changing depending on where you are on the track is the law of conservation of energy, the law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed but it can take different forms.\n\nNow we would like to talk about the mass. If the mass of the car increase then it will have more PE at the top of the hill and have more KE while going down a hill but it will have some trouble making it up the hills. But if the car mass is lower then it should make it over the hill with no problems, but it won't be very fast. that is why we have chosen to have the car mass at 48 kgs, this way it should make it over the hills and still be fast enough with the ID and the hills along the way.

I know this because in my first trial I made the height was 2.5 and that made the cart go over the hill because it had enough PE and KE.  But when I made the height really high PE increased a lot but it would increase the risk of danger happening which is the opposite of what we are trying to make.   I also think that the initial drop should be smaller because if it is higher then you would not have enough potential energy to get over the hill.  When you don't have enough PE to get over the hill then you won't have enough amount of KE. \n\n When the mass gets over the hill PE decreases and KE decreases, this is what I noticed about the relationship between KE and PE.  Pe is when the object is staying still and has a height, And then KE is when the object is moving in a downward motion, this shows how they switch between each other so at first PE is 100 and KE is 0 but when the cart goes in a downward motion then the energy becomes lower with PE and KE is 100.\n\n  The initial drop and hill height tell us if the cart is going to go over the hill.  If PE and KE have big numbers then that allows the mass of the cart to get over the hills and turns.  To make this roller coaster fun we can add some sharp turns and loops like we can add a loop in the middle of the roller coaster to get more energy to make it to the end.  And to make it safe we thought of making the hills not so high like and about 3m for the ID.\n\n  The more mass we have the more PE increases and KE is a little less than PE, so that tells us that the more mass we put on the cart the more energy is added that we need for the cart to get over the hill all the way at the end. When the height is smaller than the hill then PE will decrease but when the cart gets to the end of the roller coaster KE increases.  When the height is higher PE increases and KE at the bottom of the hill decreases. In trial one PE was at 1222 and KE was at 0, at the bottom of the hill PE was 0 and KE was1222, and my total energy was 1222. No matter what number PE is at total energy will be the exact same number of energy.  In trial one of mass & energy mass was at 50 and PE was 1955,  At the bottom of the roller coaster KE was 1947.  In my other trials, I did with Mass & Energy the more mass we have the more PE and KE increase, and the less Mass the more PE and KE decrease.\n\nThis shows how much energy and force we need for the roller coaster to be safe and fun for everyone.\n\nMass & Speed.   ID height will be 3m, I made this choice by knowing I have enough PE and KE for it to be not too fast and not too slow.  I know this because in trial one I put my height at 4m and mass at 46, when I started the simulator it was a little too slow for it to have enough pe to make it to the end and it was not fun.  In trial two I kept the ID height the same but changed the mass to 60 and it was too fast and a lot of PE and KE.  That's why I chose 3m and 50 mass because it's in the middle of both having enough PE and KE to get through the roller coaster. No matter how much mass you have it does not change PE or KE at all.

A high height of the ID will result in higher PE which will cause a higher KE, the PE at the top and KE at the bottom will be equal and the total energy will never change due to The Law of Conservation of Energy. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but it can change forms, which is why the total energy will never change and why the PE converts to KE as it moves down the track. The PE at the top of the drop is equal to the KE at the bottom because the PE converts into KE as the car moves lower until there is no PE left because the car is at ground level.  The reason that the initial drop is not higher is that in the trial where the height was 5m it resulted in the car having a PE of 2443 at the top of the drop, a KE of 2443 at the bottom of the drop, and a total energy of 2443 which could cause an unsafe ride. The reason that the initial drop is not lower is that in a trial where the ID was 2.5m high,  the car had a PE of 1222 at the top of the drop, a KE of 1222 at the bottom of the drop, and a total energy of 1222 which could result in a slow or boring ride. \n\nThe height of the hill on the coaster will be 2.5m high. As the car goes down the hill, the KE increases, and the PE decreases. The reason that the hill will not be taller is that it will not have enough energy to make it over the hill. In a trial where the height of the hill was equal to or higher than the ID height, it did not have enough energy from the drop to make it over. This hill height will allow the car to make it to the end of the track and meet the safety/excitement qualification.   \n\nThe mass of the car will be 50 kg. The higher the mass is, the higher the PE and KE will be, this is because it will have more gravitational energy acting upon it. But, the mass of the car does not affect speed, only energy. In trials, if the mass was changed, the speed stayed the same. So, the mass of the car does not matter when it comes to speed. Therefore, it does not affect the coaster's ability to meet your requirements. \n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "31", "Raw": "44", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 96", "Quality": " 0.4583", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5046", "Comprehensive": "0.4815", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 10(3), 11(3), 19(3), 27(2), 32(2), 35(2), 37(1), 42(1), 44(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 10 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... m high because the height will result in high PE and KE making it\n\t         .................... a faster and more exciting ride.\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 51 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... , the PE at the top and KE at the bottom will be equal and\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 44 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... the total energy will never change due to The Law of Conservation\n\t         .................... of Energy.\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 2": "Content Unit: 11 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: ....................

I have chosen an initial drop (ID) and a hill height (HH) that meets the fun requirement (6.7 m/s) and your safety requirement (8.4 m/s). As a reminder, we are ignoring friction. As the initial drop increases, so does PE. As you go along the track PE is converted into KE. As KE increases, speed increases. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can't be destroyed just converted;  So, we know that our total energy will always be PE+KE. \n               For one of my ID trials, I chose an ID of 3 m and the PE at the top of the drop was 1466 J which was the same as the KE at the bottom of the ride. The fun requirement was 6.7 m/s and the speed was 7.66 m/s (total energy 1466 J). That meets the requirement, but it can definitely be better. I also did a trial where the drop height was 5 m. The PE at the top of the drop was 2443 J, and the KE was 0 J. The KE at the bottom of the ride was 2443 J and the PE was 0 (total energy 2443 J). The safety requirement was 8.4 m/s and the speed was 9.89 m/s, way over. Finally, I did a trial where the drop height was 3.5 m. The PE at the top of the drop was 1710 J, and the KE was 0 J. The PE at the bottom of the drop was 0 J and the KE was 1710 J. The speed was 8.27 m/s, the perfect speed! Not too slow, not too fast.\n              Because of the Law of Conservation of energy and because we are ignoring friction, it doesn't matter what the HH is as long as it is less than the ID height because it must have enough KE to be converted into PE so that the car can get up the hill. I did three trials, one with a HH of 2 m, one with 2.25 m, and one with a HH of 4m. The two HH of 2 m and 2.25 m both made it to the end because the HH did not exceed the ID height of 3.5 m so there was enough KE to be converted into PE to make it to the top of the hill. The HH of 4 m did not make it to the end because the HH exceeded 3.5, my ID height, so there was not enough KE to be converted into PE to make it to the top of the hill. I chose a HH of 2.5 m because it was higher and so there would be more PE to be converted into KE as the car goes down the hill so there so it would be faster.\n                  It doesn't really matter what your car mass (CM) is if you are thinking about speed, which this experiment was about, but it DOES affect PE and KE. I had a range of CM from 40-60 kg and the total energy went from 1710-2053 J. SO, as CM goes up, so does the total energy. I chose a car mass of 50 kg because it does not affect speed and is in the middle of the total energy, 1369 J, to be exact!\n              All in all, I chose the HH, ID, and CM and explained all the science behind my choices. I hope you choose my company and are satisfied with the results.\n            Sincerely,\n                Our Company.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "52", "Raw": "37", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 122", "Quality": " 0.3033", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4243", "Comprehensive": "0.3638", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 17(3), 19(3), 20(2), 24(2), 27(2), 28(2), 32(2), 35(2), 44(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 28 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

The higher you are the more KE and PE there will be. From my data, I have found a relationship between PE and KE. \n\n              I have found that if PE has a high number like 1222 J. KE is 0 J. When PE is going down KE is going up at the middle of the track they were both 611 J. but by the time I got to the bottom PE was 0 J. and KE was 1222. So if you're doing a hill right after the hill as to be lower than the ID or it will not have enough energy to make it over the drop. My first hill height will be 4m tall so it can make it over. (the ID is 2.5)\n\n              The hill height will be 2.5m tall so it can make it over the hill with no problem. If it is over 3m it will not make it over due to it not having enough PE/KE.

Another reason my height is a good height is that when I tested it in my simulator the speed was 8.27m/s and that is safe but also reaches the excitement requirement (when height increases speed increases because the more time and distance it has the faster it will go). I won't go higher for my height because it will have too much speed which can be dangerous and unsafe, I know this because in my data when the ID height was 3.75M the speed was 8.57 which is dangerous to the people. The ID relates to my PE and KE by at the top of the drop should be all the energy into PE and the KE will increase when the roller coaster cart is in motion, But when the cart slows down the KE will decrease. I know all of this because in my data when the height was at 4m the PE at the top of the drop was 1955J but when the car went in motion the PE turned into KE and at the bottom of the drop the KE was 1955J. The Law of Conservation of energy says that energy can't be created, or destroyed but can be transferred into other energy. That proves that PE goes into KE.\n\n\n   The Hill Height will be 2.5 M, I think this is a good height because the cart will have enough energy from the ID to make it through the hill and the rest of the course. I know this because when the hill was the same height or more significant than the ID it would not make it over and when the hill was too small it would not be enjoyable, this is true because in my data when the ID was at 4M and my hill height was at 4M the roller coaster cart didn't make it over. The hill needs to be smaller so that there is enough PE and KE to complete the ride.\n\n\n   I think the car mass should be 50Kg because you need enough PE and KE to make it through the ride and when you increase the mass the total and potential energy go up as well. In my data, it shows when the car mass was 40kg it would have less PE and we need the perfect amount with enough to make it through the ride. When the car was 60kg it would have too much energy which can be dangerous. It doesn't matter what the mass of the car is when relating to speed, Mass doesn't affect speed. I know this because in my trials when it was 46 kg the speed was 8.85 m/s but when I increased my mass to 50 it stayed at 8.85 m/s.\n\nFrom,\n    Aiden and the team\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "41", "Raw": "43", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 111", "Quality": " 0.3874", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4931", "Comprehensive": "0.4403", "Content Unit": "2(5), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 17(3), 18(3), 23(2), 27(2), 29(2), 32(2), 35(2), 37(1), 40(1), 42(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 59 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "6278bd4430da3ae9a16a456f", "class_id": "3", "teacher_id": "GS", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "Dear Gonsales family,\nThis is what I and my team came up with for your roller coaster to be a safe and fun ride. \nFirst, the ID height will be 3 meters because the heights to choose from are 2m-5m. Why I didn't go higher because in my first essay I said that 4m was going to be the best height for the coaster but then I test mass and speed it was 8.84 m/s at 4m that was the ID height was. Which is too unsafe cause the speed should be 8.4 m/s-6.7 m/s for it to be fun and safe. Next, another reason why the ID height is at 3m and the PE at the top is 1351J and at the bottom of the drop is KE which is 1351J, and if it was at 4m the J would be 1955J at the top then 0J for the bottom of the drop for PE and KE is the same but flip that's why it is will not work.\n\nSecondly, the hill height is going to be 2.25m and I could choose between 2m and 5m but I choose this because if I increase the hill height higher like if I say 3m the hill will be too high for it to be safe cause it was at 1356J which is too high for the speed to be safe. Next, another reason is that why it is that it has to have enough energy to go through the track for it to work but also safe which why I did choose 3m cause it was too fast which was 8.84m/s that's was too fast. So I change it to 2.25m and the speed was 6.7m/s and it made it through the track safely. So the hill height has to be smaller than 3m for it to have enough energy to get through and go lower is that you would not be able to make more hills. Here is a trial, In the trial, I put the hill height at 2m then I put another hill at 2m and it didn't have enough energy.\n\nLastly, the mass of the car is going to be 46kg but it does not matter the mass of the car also cause that is the mass and energy relationship. Cause for the here are three trials to prove it. For the first trial, I put it as 50kg, and the speed at the bottom is 7.66m/s then at top of the hill is 3.81m/s. 2nd trial was 55kg and the speed at the bottom is 7.66 then at top of the hill is 3.81m/s. In the last trial, I put it at 60kg and the speed at the bottom is 7.66 then at top of the hill it 3.81m/s.\n\nID height does change the PE, KE, and TE at the top and bottom and but TE doesn't change it stays the same here is the data I put the drop height at 3m then the PE at the top of the drop was 1465J and KE was 0J and then it went to the bottom of the hill and the PE was 0J and KE was 1465. So this relationship is between PE and KE is where two energy changes into another energy. The change is the PE potential for the energy that will come and goes from the KE to the bottom of the hill. The law of energy conservation is where energy changes to another energy like PE that can have enough PE to make it through. The relation between ID and hill height is that when ID increases hill height should always be lower. Lastly, the relation between mass, PE, and KE is that the mass is it affects PE and KE. So that is my thoughts and statements on the coster that you what me and my company to built.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "52", "Raw": "50", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 122", "Quality": " 0.4098", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5734", "Comprehensive": "0.4916", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 10(3), 11(3), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 23(2), 25(2), 27(2), 32(2), 33(2), 35(2), 40(1), 42(1), 46(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 23 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

My ID relates to my PE at the top of the hill in Ke at the bottom of the hill As the car goes on ke gets higher and PE  gets lower And the car will have enough to make it to the end of the ride. Highlight relate to PE because in my data at the top of the hill the PE was 1466 End at the bottom of the hill the PE went down in the KE went up so they ke turn into 1466 And it has enough energy to make it to the end of the ride the law of conservation can change pe to ke like in trial one the pe at the top of the hill was 1222 and ke at the top of the hill was 0 and pe at the bottom of the hill was 0 and ke was 1222 at the bottoom of the hill\n\nFor hill height, I think you should put the hill at 2 .25 m because it had the best Results, And if I made it 4 M it would be too high because I put my initial drop at 4 in the car wouldn't make it over but if I put it at 2 it would make it over but it would be really like slow if we add another Hill I don't even know if I can make it over that Hill so that's why I think 2.75 is the best putting hill.\n\nFor my car Mass I picked 46 kg because It helps PE and PE helps ke cuz Kea makes the ride go faster and if the ride goes faster it is more exciting for the little kids And if it's more exciting kids want to come to this amusement park \n\n\nmy speed it is 7.6m/s per second and that is just enough because if it is above 8.4 it would be going too fast and they would be good kids would be getting hurt but if it's below 6.7 My speed is 7.60  because I change my initial drop to 3 in my hill height the 2.25 end that changed smash to 7.60 and I picked the 3 because if I picked for it would be at 8.84 and that would be going too fast and if I pick the lower than that it would be going too slow so that's why I picked 3 and 2.5 as my Hill height and initial drop And it was in the fun place In my trial to I put 5 as my initial drop in the speed was going too fast so it would have been a safe area, Okay and the speed was above 8.4 it was 9 .34\n\n\nMass really doesn't matter for the car for the speed of the car.

For the roller coaster, we need the initial drop to be 4 meters high. Therefore it's not too high and it's not too low because if it was too low you couldn't get over the hill. And we know from our trials that if the Hill height is more than the initial drop height then the cart won't get over the drop. The data states that when the initial drop for meters We got the best results. And when the cart is going down the initial drop the KE increases while the PE decreases.\n\nBut with the hill, we need the height to be 3 so it's not higher than the initial drop so the card can get over the hill therefore we make it to the end of the track. We know that we need to highlight the because in the trials it had the best results Working with the initial drop because if it's too high then the cart won't make it up the initial drop and if it's too low we won't be able to add anything else like a loop or something like that.\n\nFor the mass of our card we need it to be 46 Kg, Therefore, it's not too light and it's not too heavy because if it was too heavy we wouldn't make it up the hill and if it was too light it wouldn't have enough energy. But when we go to a higher Mass like 60 when you get higher total energy the end is Just Energy in general. and when the mass is lower we get less energy. the mass of the cart does not affect the speed for example the mass of the car was 46 KG and the speed at the end of the ride was 8.84. the mass of the cart does not affect the speed for example the mass of the car was 50 KG and the speed at the end of the ride was 8.84.\n.\n And in conclusion,\n Thank you for choosing our company to build your roller coaster.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "24", "Raw": "23", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 82", "Quality": " 0.2805", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.2638", "Comprehensive": "0.2721", "Content Unit": "3(5), 16(3), 19(3), 29(2), 32(2), 35(2), 40(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 35 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... because if it was too low you couldnt get over the hill\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 3 [Weight: 5]\n\tSegment: .................... if the Hill height is more than the initial drop height\n\t", "sentence 7 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

This is because, potential energy is energy that is stored in an object, therefore we would have more potential energy, so if we have a high initial drop, the more energy the coaster would have so the coaster could get father. I have found that this will work because when the initial drop height was larger than 3.50, the car went over the speed requirements. I know this because, in my trials, I tested anything higher than 3.50, for example, 4.25, the speed was over the speed requirement of 8.4, and that will not work for the safety of the people in the park. I will not go lower than 3.50 for the initial drop because there is also a speed requirement for the enjoyment of the people. And if we go lower than 3.50, the speed will not fulfill the speed requirements, and I want there to be a fast speed so they have fun, but also have fun well being safe.                  Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because of its motion, so if we have the ID at a good height, the more energy we would be producing, so the car could get father. It also showed in my data that when you have a higher drop height, the more KE and PE you are producing, which would result in a larger total amount of energy.\n\nSecondly, the hill height would have to be set at 2.50m. This is because in my data that when the hill height is higher or equal to the initial drop height, the coaster will not make it over the hill. I will also not go lower because I want there to be enough energy to make it to the end, In my first trial, with my hill height set at 3m and my initial drop at 4m, the car did make it over, and to the end. In my second trial with my hill height at 4m, the coaster did not make it over the hill or to the end. When the car moves down the hill the PE is decreasing and the KE is increasing.\n\nLastly, the mass of the car would be 50 kg. I choose this because the car will have enough energy to get through the track. But if there is a higher mass you will need a greater force to slow them down. I also won't go lower because I want there to be enough energy to make it through the track. Also, objects with more mass will also have more kinetic energy. So the greater the amount of mass the more KE there is in the coaster. Mass relates to kinetic energy because the KE of an object depends on mass. Mass relates to KE because when mass increases, so does PE. We choose 50 kg for mass, but in the end, it doesn't really matter what you choose. \n\nThe Law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed but can be transferred to other forms of energy within the source. This relates to PE and KE because through the track the PE and KE transfer from each other throughout the initial drop.\n\n\n\n\nFrom\nME\n\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "46", "Raw": "61", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 116", "Quality": " 0.5259", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6995", "Comprehensive": "0.6127", "Content Unit": "2(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 10(3), 12(3), 14(3), 18(3), 19(3), 27(2), 28(2), 29(2), 31(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 39(1), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 50(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

But if the hill was 3.25 it would go over because they are the same height and it would still have the energy to go over because when it went down the hill it had energy then when it went up it still had the energy because The PE initial drop was 7.96 the KE is 7.6 because it's not moving cause its the bottom so basically it's not going down a hill so it's not moving.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3185f4d8ff4cc29cca", "class_id": "1", "teacher_id": "JN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "The height that my group found best was having the Initial drop height of 5 meters high and the hill height of 4.35 meters high. At the top of the initial drop when the mass of the cart was 40kg the Potential energy was 1958 Joules and when we increased the mass to 50kg the Potential Energy was 2448 Joules this is because of gravitational potential energy. When the cart was at the end of the drop the PE was 0 because it had no height. When you find the amount of potential energy in something you use the equation mass x gravity x height (mxgxh) so 50 x 9.8 x 0. When the cart was at the bottom of the drop the PE was transferred to KE due to it not having any more height, so the KE at the end of the ride was 2442 Joules because some of that energy transformed into thermal energy (energy that can't be used). There is no kinetic energy at the top of the drop because it is not moving. To find the KE you do mass x velocity squared then divide that number by 2. So since it's stationary at the top of the drop the KE is 0. This transfer happens because of The Law of Conservation of Mass. The Law of Conservation of Mass states that no energy can be created nor destroyed but transferred. This can be shown from when the cart was at the top of the drop holding the total amount of energy because it is at rest and then transferring to KE because it is in motion going downhill with a greater velocity. When designing this coaster we had to put into consideration if we were able to make the hill height greater than the drop height, but since some energy was transferred to thermal energy it wouldn't have enough energy to get over the hill if the hill was the same height as the drop height. There for. we decided on the drop height of 5m and the hill height of 4.35m because in a frictionless environment the cart will not go over the hill if the drop is lower than the hill.  After all, it loses height due to the absence of friction. While still having the ride safe for people but wanting them to have fun the speed the cart will go is appropriate. With a mass of 50 kg and a greater drop height, the coaster can have a higher velocity this is due to air resistance. For example, if you were dropping apples one 10 feet above the ground the other 1 foot above the ground the one 10 feet above the ground would have a greater acceleration because it has more gravitational energy causing it to move faster. Mass does not affect the speed of an object because it cancels out. To explain further the equations for PE and KE put together would be mass x gravity x height = mass x velocity squared divided by 2. Since mass is on both sides of the equation they cancel each other out. They don't contribute to how fast the object is moving. But mass does affect how much PE and KE are in the object and when there is a greater PE that means that there's going to be a greater KE which means a greater acceleration. \n\n\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "45", "Raw": "63", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 115", "Quality": " 0.5478", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7225", "Comprehensive": "0.6352", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 10(3), 12(3), 15(3), 18(3), 20(2), 22(2), 27(2), 31(2), 32(2), 34(2), 36(1), 37(1), 42(1), 44(1), 47(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 18 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: ....................

Since there are no extra \"pushes\" being added throughout the roller coaster, we need to make sure that the cart is able to have the most PE right at the beginning as possible. The more PE we are able to get right from the start, the more KE there will be to keep the cart moving at a constant speed. This brings me to our next topic. How are we supposed to get the most KE possible?  We have established that an initial drop of 5 meters will most likely keep the cart moving at a constant speed. But what we discovered is that there has to be less mass present in the cart for a better outcome of KE. Although a less mass cart will not have as much PE, it will have a better and stronger KE that could make the cart go through the whole roller coaster. Also with KE, there is the most of it at the bottom of the rollercoaster than there is at the top because there is less PE. If you were to look at our data, you would see that the total energy at the beginning of a trial will be the same as the PE at the top of the initial drop. This is because energy can't be destroyed or created. It can only be transformed into different kinds of energy. Because of this, even when the cart is in the middle of the rollercoaster, the total energy will be the same. Even if it converts into sound or thermal energy. \n\nAlso to keep the roller coaster moving safely, we have to think about the heights that the hill and loop have to be. After many trials, we concluded that the hill and loop must be shorter than the initial drop. If it is taller or even the same height as the initial drop, there wouldn't be enough KE for the cart to be moving and the cart could go backward. This would also mean that the cart itself would have to be a smaller mass. Even though we could get more PE from having a bigger mass of a cart, the KE would probably not be enough to get through the whole rollercoaster. So, my team and I have decided that the best and safest mass for the cart should be 40kg. \n\nWith the cart mass in mind, we now can talk about what the PE and KE would look like at the top and bottom of the hills and the initial drop. With a 40kg cart, the PE at the top of the initial drop should be 1959J of energy and 1954J of energy at the bottom of the initial drop. But if we were to run through the simulation, you would see that there is no KE at the top of the initial drop, and when the cart reaches the bottom of the initial drop that the PE would be zero. This is because KE is dependent on how fast or slow the object is moving. Therefore you will see the most KE at the bottom of the jills and loops rather than the top of them. This also means that because PE is dependent on the height of an object, there will not be as much PE at the start of the rollercoaster in the end. If you were to go through the simulation, you would see that there is more PE present as you go up the hills rather than coming down. With that being said, if we wanted to gain more PE, we would have to make the hills and loops taller but still shorter than the initial drop. \n\nSpeed is also a really big part on if the rollercoaster we design for the family. Although at the start of the trials. my team wanted to start at the maximum height (5m), we found that the speed in which the cart would go was 9.83 m/s. While researching other rollercoasters, we found that the speed that the cart was going, was unsafe and not fit for the rollercoaster we want to make. After many more trials, we concluded that the safest initial drop height is 3m. This way, the rollercoaster will still go at a thrilling speed, but still will avoid any injuries in the process. \n\nEven though a 3m initial drop will only bring the cart to a speed of 7.69 m/s, we are still able to increase the speed using the relationship between mass and PE. Through our research, we found that mass does not affect speed, but does affect PE. Therefore, if we make the mass of the car higher, the PE will increase. But how will this affect speed? We already know that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but it can transfer. While the cart goes down the initial drop, the PE decreases but the KE increases. This is because the PE is transferring into KE. So, the more PE we are able to gain from the initial drop, the more KE or speed we can gain as well. \n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "59", "Raw": "52", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 129", "Quality": " 0.4031", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5963", "Comprehensive": "0.4997", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 10(3), 13(3), 16(3), 17(3), 19(3), 23(2), 27(2), 29(2), 34(2), 35(2), 37(1), 38(1), 39(1), 42(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 61(1), 62(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 13 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: ....................

This is because sense this is the biggest drop containing the most PE at the top and KE at the bottom, this ensures that you will have enough PE to finish off the ride strong. This will also be effected with speed because the more speed the car has the more KE the cart will have. The potential energy will play a huge part in the ride so it will be important to contain as much PE as possible with the initial drop. This drop is converting its energy because its not being created or destroyed but instead is going to stay the same. \n\n\nMoving on now that we know that the Gonzales family will need a higher Initial drop to contain enough PE and KE we measured this in are experiment by playing around with different heights and masses for the drops and the carts mass. We found that a 3.75 meter drop worked for the initial drop as we stated above and that a good hill height was 3.25. We though this would work as a hill height because the hill is located near the ending of the ride and we could not do a higher height otherwise there would be to much PE stored at the end of the ride and it would not be a safe stop. The data we found was if we increased the hill height then the speed would be really unsafe at a speed of about 8.55 J at the end of the ride which is way to dangerous. Instead we decided to go for a much smaller hill height witch made the ending speed about 6.5 with friction. \n\n\nWe know this will be safe for the riders because the roller carts will be able to carry 50 kilograms but it wont be to heavy to not make it over certain obstacles. We decided to make the mass of the roller coaster 50 because it was not to heavy but not to lite. This mass was perfect and made it through every obstecle on the treack and kept the rollercoster maintaining a solid speed.\n\n\n Continuing through the ride there will be hill after the loop to make sure it is not at a out of control speed so it safe, there will be a mini drop after the hill to give the riders a break then the riders will go down a huge thrilling drop extending lower to the ground for the final big drop continuing with another loop and going backwards. We will end the ride with a slower ending in a straight line to ensure the safe stop and to slow down the potential energy a bit more.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3185f4d8ff4cc29ccf", "class_id": "1", "teacher_id": "JN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "To have an exciting and safe roller coaster, there are many factors that we should consider and/or implement. We can begin by looking at how the initial height drop relates to the PE at the top, and the KE at the bottom. If we look at our trials we can notice that the higher the release height is, the higher the PE will be because the two have a direct relationship. As for the KE, in a frictionless environment by the end of the drop, if the height is 0m, the KE will have all of the previous potential energy, which is a representation of the inverse relationship between KE and PE. A trial example is a release height of 3m and a PE at the top of 1612 J, the KE at the bottom was 1611 J as there was a height of 1m remaining. We can compare this to a similar trial in which the release height was 4m, the initial PE was 2150 J and the final KE at the bottom was 2149 J with 1m of height. \n\nAt the end of all of these trials centered around kinetic and potential energy, we can observe that the sum of both at any given point is always the amount of total energy. This is because of the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but changed into other forms of energy, so the sum of the two will ALWAYS be equivalent to the TE.\n\nIn addition, on the way down the drop, the PE will shift into KE as it descends, this has to do with their inverse relationship and it also relates to the Law of Conservation of Energy. The energy cannot be created nor destroyed so to maintain the inverse relationship the energy will shift forms. This means that the total energy will remain the same the entire time, even with the energy transfer, so PE at the top is equivalent to KE at the bottom of the hill. \n\nWhen we begin to look at the addition of a hill on our ride we can observe multiple things, among the most important being the relationship between drop height and hill height. If we look at a trial with the initial drop height of 4m and a hill height of 3m, we can see that the cart successfully made it over the hill. However, when experimenting with hill heights higher than the drop such as a hill that was 5m with a drop height of 4m, the cart did not have enough kinetic energy to make it over the hill. So, our observations suggest that we should have a hill height that is less than the initial drop height.\n\nSimilar to height and PE, mass and energy have a direct relationship. When we increased the mass of the cart in a frictionless environment the PE and KE numbers also increased. In a trial we ran with a 50kg cart, the PE was 2203J and the KE at the bottom was 2200J with a bit of remaining height. In comparison, with a cart mass of 60kg with a PE of 2644J and KE of 2641J, we can see that the cart with a higher mass had more energy. So it looks like having a car with a higher mass would be beneficial, in a frictionless environment mass affects KE and PE in a direct relationship.\n\nIn contrast, however, having a higher mass has no effect on speed, and I could see problems with having higher mass in an environment with friction, which our final roller coaster will have. The mass has no effect on velocity, the vector similar to speed, and the equations to calculate PE and KE reflect this. When we take the equations and try to isolate velocity, (PE top) mass x gravity x height = (KE bottom) Â½ mass x velocity^2, we can observe that mass will cancel out because it is on both sides of the equation. The real equation to give us velocity is, velocity = â(2 x gravity x height) so if we want higher velocity we can really only increase the height of the ride. If mass doesn't have an effect on speed and the higher the mass is the more air resistance it will have, it might be best to pick a medium to low mass. \n\nTo see this in action we will compare two trials where the cart's mass was 40kg and 45kg. At the bottom of the drop, we can see that both trials had a speed of 8.27 m/s then the speed at the top of the hill was 3.10 m/s, and finally an end speed of 8.27 m/s. So, if we go with a mid to low mass of the cart, and we keep a higher drop height with friction, we will have a quick speed and a fun roller coaster.\n\nIf you look at the trials where the initial drop height was 5kg, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.87 m/s which is obviously much too fast for safety, however with direction coming into play and a car with a bit more mass I think that we will have fewer problems with the speed being too fast.

As the roller cart goes down the drop Its potential energy starts changing into kinetic energy as it drops. for example, If we had a PE of 50 Joules at the top of a drop, in the middle of that drop it would have changed its energy into KE so they would be evenly split into 25 Joules of energy each, 50/50. for our roller coaster without any friction the PE and the KE will remain the same no matter what at the end of each trial because energy can not be created or destroyed it can only change its forms. if it had friction the energy would be lost and it would change into several different forms but if we added all those forms of energy together that came from the coaster it would stay the same. the hill height of the roller coaster has to be taller than any of the other hills. this is because height and potential energy are related to one another. the more height that you have the more PE you will have.\nour drop height for the roller coaster is taller than the hill height so that we know that the cart will make it safely over the hill and so that the passengers do not get stuck on the ride and create a negative experience for the riders. \nif we want to have the max PE and KE you want to have a more massive cart since when you increase the mass you increase the total energy of the cart.\n\nI choose these because they have the best overall results and for the ride while making the ride both fast and entertaining and safe. when we choose the initial drop height we choose it because the more speed to make sure to make it over the hill.\nthe height of the drop matters a lot since it is in the equation of velocity. so when making the roller coaster the more height we have on a drop the faster it will go. mass does not affect speed since it is not in the equation of velocity.\nPE and KE have a direct relationship because when one goes up the other goes down just like on the roller coaster the energy is never lost and stays at an exact total unless friction is involed.\nThe law of conservation of energy is not energy can be created or destroyed but it can change forms our design is for a frictionless environment so the total energy form never changes making the energies always at max throughout the ride.\n\nI hope you consider our design and agree with it.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "45", "Raw": "50", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 115", "Quality": " 0.4348", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5734", "Comprehensive": "0.5041", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 9(4), 10(3), 11(3), 13(3), 16(3), 21(2), 22(2), 23(2), 33(2), 34(2), 35(2), 42(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The height of the new roller coaster will be 5 meters, which will help get the roller coaster the fastest speed possible. As an example, when our height of the drop was 5 M, the total energy of the coaster was 2932 joules, which is much more compared to when the height was 2 M, and the TE was only 1173 J. \n\nTo get the total energy, we would add our total Kinetic Energy with our Potential Energy. There was more PE at the top of the drop than KE at the top of the drop. For example, when our height was 5 M the PE at the top was 2932 J and the KE at the top was 0. This is because it is not moving when it is at the top, but it has the potential to move. And vise versa, when it is at the bottom of the drop the Kinetic Energy was 2930 J, and the PE was 1 or 0. \n\nNow to talk about our energy transformation and the law of conservation of energy. Our energy would normally get transformed into friction, or sound energy, etc... But we were able to remove friction from the ride, which makes it so our ride is friction less and doesn't slow unless there is a hill. The law of conservation of energy, which states that \"energy can not be created nor destroyed\" is evident in our simulation. In our trials we could see that we did not lose any total energy throughout the simulation and the TE at the bottom = TE at the top (for example when our Initial drop was 4 the TE at the top was 2346 J and the bottom was also 2346 J). \n\nNow, onto the relationship of our drop and hill height. When our drop height was 5 m, our cart could make it to the top of hill heights  of 3 m and 4 m, but could not make it to 5 m. When our hill height was the same as the drop height, it did not have enough energy to make it to the top of the hill (2939 J wasn't enough). But with the other trials we did have enough energy to make it over the hill and to the end of the ride. \n\nAlso, Mass does not affect the speed of a ride. In my trials, when my mass was 60 KG, the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88 M/s, and when my mass was 40 KG, the speed at the end was equally 9.88 M/S\n\nFinally, lets analyze the relationship of mass, PE, and KE. When our mass of our cart was 40 KG and our initial drop height was 5 M, our total energy was 1958 J. Now, when our mass was 60 KG and the drop was 5 M, our total energy was 2937 J, which makes it evident that with more mass we get more KE, PE, and TE.

The higher the height the more potential energy is present and therefore the more kinetic energy when PE=KE. Setting the release height at 3m the amount of potential energy at the initial drop was 1618J, and the amount of kinetic energy was 0J since the cart was sitting still. The amount of potential energy decreases at the bottom of the drop since the cart was slightly off the ground, now it was at 1J. The amount of kinetic energy, however, increased to 1617J. Setting the height to 5m the amount of total energy was increased. The potential energy at the initial drop was 2697J, while the kinetic energy was at 0J. At the bottom of the drop, the potential energy was 1J, and the kinetic energy was 2696J. \n\nThe Law of conservation of Energy states that energy can be transformed into other kinds of energy but cannot be created or destroyed. At 3m and 5m, the energy always added up to be the same total amount. So potential energy added to kinetic energy equals the total energy an object has. While the cart travels down the tracks about halfway through the energies are about 50/50. Closer to the top you could say the energy was split 25/75. That's because as you lose height the potential energy decreases while the kinetic energy increases due to the motion of the object. \n\nWhen you add a hill you want the height of the hill to be less than the initial drop. Setting the hill height to 3m and the initial drop to 4m, there was 2144J of potential energy at the initial drop and 0J of kinetic energy. At the top of the hill, the potential energy was 1619J, while the kinetic energy was 525J. You have to have enough kinetic energy for the cart to get over the hill and to make it to the end of the track, in this scenario the cart was able to get over the hill and to the end. \nBut when setting the height to 4m and the initial drop at 4m, the potential energy at the initial drop was 2147J and the kinetic energy was 0J. At the top of the hill, the potential energy was 2127J and the kinetic energy was 20J. The potential energy decreases the amount from the initial drop to the top of the hill. But there is not enough kinetic energy still left at the top of the hill it is not able to get over, so when the hill height and the initial drop were equal the cart was not able to get over the hill and to the end. The less mass the less energy you have, the more mass the more energy you have. \n\nWhen setting the mass of the cart at 40kg the potential energy at the initial drop is 1763J, but when setting the mass of the cart to 60kg the potential energy was 2644J, which shows a significant increase. The kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop, when the mass was set at 40kg, was 1736J, some of the energy was still potential energy. The kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop, when the mass was set at 60kg, was 2604J. The more weight added to an object the more energy it has. \n\nThroughout the course of the track the potential energy and kinetic energy increase and decrease, the total energy never changes. The most potential energy the object is going to have is at the top of the initial drop, and the most kinetic energy the object will have is at the bottom of the initial drop. As the cart travels up the hill potential energy starts to build up again and kinetic energy decreases. Throughout the ride, kinetic energy builds up while going down the initial drop, then decreases while going up the hill, and increases again while going down the hill.  \n\n3.5m for the initial height. This is because it was the safest option, it had the least speed out of the heights I tried. At the bottom of the drop, it had 8.27 m/s. When the height was increased to 4.5m the speed was 9.38 m/s. That would be too fast of a drop and would hurt the people in the cart. \n\nKnowing that height affects the total energy, and mass affects the total energy. There needs to be more mass for the cart to have enough energy to make it to the end. While collecting data I saw that changing the mass had no effect on speed. Throughout the trials, I set the mass to 40kg, 45kg, and 50kg. Each cart had 8.27m/s at the bottom of the drop, and 8.27 m/s speed at the end of the ride. To ensure that the cart gets to the end, while also making sure no one gets hurt. I decided on 3.5m for the initial drop, 3m for the hill height, and 50kg for the cart.\n\nSetting the height to 3.5m will ensure that the speed is under 8.4 m/s and also guarantee that people have fun because it will be over 6.7 m/s. The mass will not affect the speed, and since the height is a little low, 50kg will ensure that the car builds up enough energy to make it to the end.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "71", "Raw": "76", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.5714", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.8716", "Comprehensive": "0.7215", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 9(4), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 13(3), 14(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 27(2), 32(2), 33(2), 37(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 51 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Based on my data would highly recommend that the initial drop height should be 3.5m high, the hill height should be 3m high, and the loop height should be 2.5m high then we should place a flat at the end to slow down the ride. With all this being added the roller coaster will achieve a maximum speed of 8.3 m/s which is very fast but it safe since it is less than 8.4 m/s which is considered unsafe.\n\n            To prove this point I will include that PE is based on the height of the drop since PE is the energy stored due to an object's position which means the higher it is the higher the potential energy it has but there would be no KE since it is not moving. KE is the energy something has because of its motion. At the bottom of the drop, the KE must be enough to go to the end of the ride, there would be no PE because the object is at the bottom of the drop which means it would have no height.\n\n             I would recommend that the height of the initial drop be 3.5m and the hill height be 3m because during the data when the hill height was the same height or is higher than the initial drop it would not make it to the end or even make it over the hill. This happens because the KE at the bottom of the drop would not be adequate enough for the car to go over the hill. \n\n            The total energy would be the same throughout because the PE and KE will just convert from each other, I know this will happen because the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can not be created nor destroyed but only converted from one energy to another energy. To bring it into the ride, the top of the hill when it was not moving in a frictionless world only contained PE which meant that the PE was the total energy but when it went down the drop the PE transferred to KE since it was moving, the total energy did not change at all though because of the law of conservation of energy. \n\n             The mass is directly related to PE and KE since the more mass an object contains the more energy PE and KE there would be. This makes perfect sense because we know that in the equations for finding PE and KE mass would be involved and the more mass you had in the equations the more PE or KE there would be. To bring in the data, when the car's mass was 40kg the PE at the top of the drop would be 1763 J and the KE at the bottom of the drop would be 1723 J. When the car mass was 60kg the PE at the top of the drop was 2644 J and the KE at the bottom of the drop was 2635 J.\n\n              Height effects speed heavily because the higher the car is the more velocity which means the more KE there is which would result in having more speed. To bring in the data, when the heigh was 4m the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.83 m/s. When the height was 5m the speed was 9.87 m/s. This data proves that the higher the car is the more speed there is.\n\n              As the car went down the drop the PE that it had at the initial drop would convert to KE. This makes sense because as the car goes down the drop it is moving which means that kinetic energy took place which would ultimately mean that the PE at the top of the initial drop converted to KE. Also, another reason why the PE would convert is that PE is the energy stored due to its position, and since the car is going down the initial drop it would mean that it would lose its height, and that would cause the PE to convert to KE.\n\n             The PE is the total energy at the top of the hill because it is at its highest position and it is not moving which means that there would be no KE. As the car goes downhill though the PE can only convert to KE since it is moving because of the law of conservation of energy. This means that as it goes down the potential energy will decrease since it is converting to KE. When the car goes up the hill the PE increases since it is getting higher and higher up which means that it would increase. The PE does not increase randomly, it increases also since the KE converts some of its energy to PE as the cart is rising. To add more, the car has the most PE at the top of the initial drop and the most KE at the bottom of the hill. Just to make sure everything is clear, PE is when an object has energy stored due to its position above the ground and KE is the energy something has because of its motion, I would recommend to the Gonzales family that they should have a higher initial drop than their hill height since we are running on mechanical energy, to make things safer the height should not be too high so that means that a good height would be 3.5m. \n\n            To prove this point I will include that PE is based on the height of the drop since PE is the energy stored due to an object's position which means the higher it is the higher the potential energy it has but there would be no KE since it is not moving. KE is the energy something has because of its motion. At the bottom of the drop, the KE must be enough to go to the end of the ride, there would be no PE because the object is at the bottom of the drop which means it would have no height.\n\n            I would recommend that the height of the initial drop be 3.5m and the hill height be 3m because during the data when the hill height was the same height or is higher than the initial drop it would not make it to the end or even make it over the hill. This happens because the KE at the bottom of the drop would not be adequate enough for the car to go over the hill. \n\n            The total energy would be the same throughout because the PE and KE will just convert from each other, I know this will happen because the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can not be created nor destroyed but only converted from one energy to another energy. \n\n             The mass is directly related to PE and KE since the more mass an object contains the more energy PE and KE there would be. This makes perfect sense because we know that in the equations for finding PE and KE mass would be involved and the more mass you had in the equations the more PE or KE there would be.

When the car mass was 60kg the PE at the top of the drop was 2644 J and the KE at the bottom of the drop was 2635 J. \n\n              To include more though, since we have been doing the simulation without any friction the mass would not affect the speed, in the real world there would be friction and the more mass something had the faster it was but since we are doing the ride without any friction did not affect the speed of the ride. To prove this I will bring in the data that we did on how mass affects speed, when the mass was 40kg the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.27 m/s and the speed at the top of the hill was 3.10 m/s and the speed at the end of the ride was 8.27m/s. When the mass was 50kg the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.27 m/s and at the top of the hill was 3.10 m/s and at the end of the ride was 8.27m/s. From my data we can interpret that mass does not affect the speed in a frictionless world. Since in the simulation mass does not affect speed, I would choose 40kg so that more people could ride in the car of the roller coaster.\n\n              As the car went down the drop the PE that it had at the initial drop would convert to KE. This makes sense because as the car goes down the drop it is moving which means that kinetic energy took place which would ultimately mean that the PE at the top of the initial drop converted to KE. Also, another reason why the PE would convert is that PE is the energy stored due to its position, and since the car is going down the initial drop it would mean that it would lose its height, and that would cause the PE to convert to KE.\n\n             The PE is the total energy at the top of the hill because it is at its highest position and it is not moving which means that there would be no KE. As the car goes downhill though the PE can only convert to KE since it is moving because of the law of conservation of energy. This means that as it goes down the potential energy will decrease since it is converting to KE. When the car goes up the hill the PE increases since it is getting higher and higher up which means that it would increase. The PE does not increase randomly, it increases also since the KE converts some of its energy to PE as the cart is rising. To add more, the car has the most PE at the top of the initial drop and the most KE at the bottom of the hill. Just to make sure everything is clear, PE is when an object has energy stored due to its position above the ground and KE is the energy something has because of its motion.\n\n             Just to make sure everything makes sense, the height affects the PE because the higher something is the more PE you have. It also affects the KE since the higher something is the more velocity there is which would result in more kinetic energy since velocity is part of the equation to get KE. It would also affect total energy because the higher something is the more PE and KE there is which would mean that there would be more total energy compared to something that is lower than it is. To talk about how mass affects PE and KE we can say that since mass is in both equations that we use to find KE and PE that means that the more mass you have the more PE and KE there are. The more PE and KE there is the more total energy there is.\n              \n              The Law of Conservation of energy affects my design because based on everything I have said, the higher something is the more PE and KE there is which would result in there being too much total energy would increase. This would mean that the PE as it goes down the drop would convert to KE more than it already was and that would mean that my car would go too fast and would be very unsafe which is not the goal.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "147", "Raw": "67", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.5038", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7683", "Comprehensive": "0.6361", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 7(4), 13(3), 17(3), 18(3), 20(2), 25(2), 27(2), 28(2), 29(2), 31(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 38(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 38 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... m high, the hill height should be m high, and the loop height\n\t         .................... should be.\n\t", "sentence 11 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3185f4d8ff4cc29cbc", "class_id": "1", "teacher_id": "JN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "What I would recommend the Gonzales family have an initial drop higher than the hills they are going to put on the roller coaster then finally a smaller drop. I say this because the height of the drop affects the amount of potential energy and kinetic energy at the top of the drop which will also later affect speed. Potential Energy is energy stored at the start of the ride and Kinetic energy is moving energy. \n\nIn my group, we decided to use different heights as testers to see what would happen to the roller coaster at the start and finish of the drop. The first height we used was 2 and the potential energy started off as 1079 joules and the kinetic energy was 0 joules. Once we released the roller coaster and it finally came to a stop the  Potential energy at the bottom was 1 joule and the Kinetic energy had become 1078 joules leaving the total amount of energy to be 1079 joules. With the second height, we used the height of 5 and had potential energy of 2697 joules and kinetic energy of 0. When we released the roller coaster this time around you could see an increase in speed since it had more energy when it was converting to kinetic. At the end of this drop, the total potential energy was 1 joule and kinetic energy was 2696 joules leaving the total energy as 2697 joules. You can see that there was a significant change in the total energy when we changed the height which would be one variable to let the rollercoaster go faster when going down the hill. \n\nThe relationship between potential, kinetic, and total energy states that both potential energy and kinetic energy always have to add up to the total energy due to the Law of conservation of mass that states Energy cannot be destroyed just transferred to a different kind of energy. This is why in the previous data the Potential energy and Kinetic energy kept transferring energy to one another as they were going down the hill and always adding up to the total energy since it cannot be destroyed. For example, at the top of the hill, the potential energy would have 7 joules of energy and the kinetic would be zero; at the bottom, the kinetic would be 7 joules and the potential would be 0 and during the process of going down the drop the potential and kinetic energy could be different amounts of kinetic energy but always add up to 7 joules. This is because the energy \"changed\" into different energy. \n\nThough both Kinetic and Potential transfer to one another the total energy always stays the same no matter what. The total energy is always the same amount of potential energy at the initial drop of a roller coaster. For example, at the start, the potential energy could be 1618 joules of PE and the total energy would be 1618, and so forth. As we just explained how the Initial drop is key to having high total energy for a fast roller coaster you also have to keep in mind hill height. When my team and I were experimenting with different hill heights to use for an initial drop of 5 meters we learned that the hill height has to be any number smaller than your initial drop or else it won't make it over the hill if it's the same height as your drop. This is proven in our experiments since when we used an initial height of five and tested hill heights of 2, 3, 4, and 5 meters the only height that didn't make it was 5 meters. Now the last concept is knowing how the mass of the roller coaster affects the Potential energy and kinetic energy it has for speed to go down the hill and make it to the end of the ride. \n\nWhen we tested later on about height and mass we decided that the roller coaster should hold an average mass of 60kg, an initial drop height of 3 meters, a hill height of 2.5, and a loop height of two. We chose these specific numbers because in all our trials of different drop heights we learned that either the speeds were at dangerous levels or it didn't make it over the other required parts of the rollercoaster. For example, when we tested the initial drop height of 5 the speed was 9.88 m/s/s which is way over dangerous levels. This case was the same with the height of 4 and 3.5 therefore we resorted to the hill height of three that just met the requirement of 8.4 and still made it over the other parts of the rollercoaster heights with maintaining a safe speed and making it over. We chose the mass of 60kg because it would allow the roller coaster to store more potential and total energy in the ride which would transfer to kinetic moving energy. This could also be helpful since it would be able to store more people in the coaster as well as benefit the energys that will be present. \n\nWhile doing our experiments we learned that mass has nothing to do with the speed of the roller coaster since the speed is only dependent on the height and velocity. This can be proven due to the fact when we experimented with the same drop height and hill height we learned that all the end speeds at different points of the roller coaster ended up the same. For example, we used the initial drop height of 5 and hill height of 3.5 for all of them, we tested for the mass of 40 and mass of 50 and we got the same exact speed at the end of the ride which was 9.88 m/s/s. This is because the hill height, potential energy, total energy, and gravity stay the same therefore potential energy and kinetic energy equations can cancel out mass and it wouldn't affect anything. Velocity is dependent on Gravity and height, not mass. This doesn't happen in real life because objects that have less mass but have more air resistance allow to go slower rather than an object with less air resistance.

This initial drop with the height. Say the drop height is 5 meters. The potential energy at the top of the drop will be 2688 jewels, so the amount of potential energy would be higher than if the drop was 3 meters. The height relates to kinetic energy just like it relates to potential energy. Like potential energy, the kinetic energy would be more if the height is higher. If the height of the drop is 5 meters and there is no friction the kinetic energy would be 2688 jewels. The energy would transfer. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed. This would explain why the potential energy and kinetic energy would transfer each other's energy at the top and bottom of the drop.\n\n Like the drop, the hill and its height are another crucial part of the Gonzales family's rollercoaster.

There would be enough potential and kinetic to make it down the hill but, there would not be enough potential and kinetic energy to make it over the hill. To help the cart make it over the hill you would need enough potential energy at the start, and kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop to make it over that hill. Since there is no friction being added right now all you would need is a higher initial drop than the height of the hill. If the height of the initial drop is 4 meters and the height of the hill is 3 meters there will be enough total energy for the cart to make it up and over the hill.\nLast is the mass of the cart. This will determine if the cart is too heavy to get over that hill. The heavier the cart is, the more total energy that car will have going down the drop but it may have too much mass to make it over that hill.\n\n The PE at the top of the drop relates a lot to the KE at the bottom of the drop. This goes back to the law of conservation of energy. If there is a lot of PE at the top of the drop there will be a lot of KE at the bottom. This could change but we are working with zero friction. Say the PE that is stored at the top of the initial drop is a low amount. As it goes down the drop the KE won't be higher than that PE because energy can not be added. If we were working with friction the energy would most likely decrease but this energy isn't disappearing. It's turning into thermal energy or sound energy or any kind of energy.\n\n The height and speed both relate and work together. Say the height is 5 meters and there is no friction. The top speed of the ride will be 9.37. Which is too fast to be safe. to drop the speed you would lower the drop height or add friction but right now we're working with no friction. If you lower the height to 4.5 meters it still won't be safe because the top speed will be 9.37. At this rate, the drop would need to be lowered quite a bit for the satisfaction and safety of the passengers. We may need to drop the height to 3.5 or even 3 meters.\n If we are working with friction, the height of the drop will still affect the speed but the higher the friction the slower it will go. At a 4-meter drop height will 0.5 friction it will go a little bit slower than it did when it had no friction.\n\n The mass and speed also relate but in a different way than height and speed. Since gravity can not be created or destroyed the gravity will be 9.8 Jewels the whole ride. This means whether the cart is 80kg or 30kg the speed will be the same each time. This is with no friction but the outcome will be different with friction. The cart with less mass will have a better chance of making it to the end than the car with more mass, because of something called air resistance. If you've heard the word arrow dynamic air resistance is just like it. The smaller the cart the less air resists the motion of the cart. The higher the kg of the cart, the bigger the cart is. This means that more air resists the cart and slows down the cart a tiny bit. Since the lower kg cart, resists less air the cart will move faster than the higher kg cart.\n\n The PE and KE also relate to mass. The more mass the cart has, the more PE the cart will have at the top of the drop. Since energy can't be created or destroyed the PE would transfer to KE at the bottom of the drop. So the more mass the cart has the more PE and KE the cart will have.\n\n All of those reasons will be used to make this roller coaster happen. You need to balance height, mass, and velocity to make this roller coaster safe and fun for the Gonzales family.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "74", "Raw": "71", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.5338", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.8142", "Comprehensive": "0.6740", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 13(3), 15(3), 16(3), 19(3), 21(2), 23(2), 27(2), 31(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 37(1), 38(1), 39(1), 42(1), 44(1), 47(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 5 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 11 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: ....................

We decided on this because its a big drop to make the roller coaster look exciting and if its smaller then the the hill height it wont even make it over, so the higher you have the initial drop the bigger the hill can be. Also it will give the ride more energy and make the rest if the roller coaster faster and be able to go over higher drops. For example when the drop height was 2m, the total energy was 1038, but when it was 5m the total was 2707. This shows that the higher the drop the more energy. If you look at the relationship between PE and KE and the height 5m you see that the PE starts at the total amount with 0 KE. thats because the object is at rest and not in motion and when its at the bottom of the drop the energy transfers to KE but 1J of PE is still there so in  this case it would be 2706 when the total is 2707. \n\nWhile the cart is going down the drop is when the KE and PE transfer but according the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed thats why the energy doesn't go anywhere and stays the same. Although if those numbers are different from the top to bottom of drop it just means the energy was being used on something else like thermal or sound energy, but it is still there. If we look more at the relationship between the drop height and the hill height we can see that we need the drop height to be higher to make it over the hill, so when the drop height is 5m and the hill height is 3.5m it made it over the hill. when we put the hill height as 5m it did not make it over the hill. Thats because the drop height and hill height where the same and the cart did not have enough energy to make it over. We think that a good height for the hill would be between 3.5-4m because it will make it over and have enough energy to do other drops and hills after. Also we think that the mass height shouldn't be to heavy and more on the lighter side because with less mass it will have more energy. We know this because when we tested the car mass at 40 there was 1956 and when it was 60 there was 2934 total energy. That also shows  the more mass the more PE and KE and the less mass the less PE and KE. For the mass i found out that the mass only affects the PE and not the speed.\n\n I found this out when i tested different masses with the same height. Each time i added more or less mass the velocity stayed the same. For example when the mass was 40 the end speed was 9.88 and when the mass was 50 and 60 the end speed was also 9.88. This shows that the mass doesn't affect the speed but the height does because the higher the drop is the more time it has to gain energy so the more PE and KE there will be. So when we are trying to find what mass to put the cart at we should probably do something around 50kg so it isn't to fast it injures somebody but not to slow so it can be fun. The relationship between PE and KE transfer while the cart is going down the hill so the total energy will always be the same. If the final numbers arent the same that means the other energy is being used on something else like thermal energy or sound. So the law of conservation of mass shows that energy cant be created or destroyed thats why its always there.

Now I will show you the science behind our roller coaster that we have created so far.\n\nThe initial drop height relates to potential energy at the top and kinetic energy at the bottom. In my data, the higher the initial drop, the more potential energy and kinetic energy there is. For example, my data shows that with a drop height of 5m the potential energy at the top is 2932 joules and the kinetic energy at the bottom is 2930 joules. With a lower drop height of 4m the potential energy at the top was 2346 joules and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2344 joules.\n\nThere is a direct relationship between potential energy, kinetic energy and total energy. According to my data, the potential energy was always the same amount as the total energy. And the kinetic energy was always similar but less than the potential and total energy. For example, with a 3m drop of potential energy being 1759 joules, the total energy was also 1759 joules but the kinetic energy was 1758 joules.\n\nAccording to my data, as the cart when down the drop the potential energy was converted into kinetic energy. For example, the potential energy at the top of a 5m drop was 2932 joules but at the bottom it was 1 joule. For that same drop, the kinetic energy at the top was 0 but then at the bottom it was 2930 joules.\n\nThe law of conservation of energy states that when one form of energy is transferred to another, no energy is created or destroyed in the process. When i was doing my data i noticed almost all the PE was converting into KE as the cart was going down the drop. I saw this on the initial drop with the 5m drop the PE was 2932 joules when the cart got to the bottom most of the PE converted into KE so the KE was 2930 joules with only 1 joule of PE not converted. The energy was not destroyed just converted because when i looked in my data the total energy matched the same amount of PE energy there was at the top of the drop which was 2932 joules.\n\nThere is a direct relationship between drop height and hill height. To prove this to you, when I tried a 5m drop with a 5m hill, the cart did not make it over the 5m hill due to the cart not having enough kinetic energy. Then when I tried a 4m hill with the same drop, the cart had enough energy to make it over the hill. So the drop height needed to always be higher than the hill height for the cart to have enough energy to go over the next hill.\n\nThere is a relationship between mass, potential energy and kinetic energy. According to my data, while using a 5m drop, the larger the mass, the more potential and kinetic energy there was. To prove this, when I used a 50kg cart, the potential energy was 2435 joules and the kinetic energy was 2435 joules. When I used the 60kg cart on the same drop, the potential energy was 2937 joules and the kinetic energy was the same.\n\nAccording to my data, the mass did not affect the speed of the cart. The height of the drop directly affected the speed of the cart. The higher the drop, the faster the speed of the cart. When I had a 5 drop, the speed at the bottom of the hill was 9.89m/s. Then when I tried a 4.5m drop, the speed at the bottom was 9.37m/s. When I changed the mass of the cart, there was no affect to the speed. For example, in my data, when I had the same initial drop of 5m the 60kg cart had a speed of 9.89m/s which is the same as when I tried the 50kg cart.\n\n\nMy decision for height and mass was 60kg carts and 5m initial drop. I chose the 60 kg cart because it went just as fast as the other kg carts. I also chose the 5m height drop due to the fact that the higher the height, the more speed there was. These were the two decisions I made for the best roller coaster design.\n\n\n\nAs you can see Mr Gonzales, we have used science and data to create a functioning roller coaster design. This will be a good addition to any theme park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "62", "Raw": "68", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 132", "Quality": " 0.5152", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7798", "Comprehensive": "0.6475", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 2(5), 6(4), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 13(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 27(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 40(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 40 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Some of my suggestions are that the initial drop of the roller coast should be 4 meters, and the hill height should be 3 meters. To make the car go over everything, the car mass has to be lower. My suggestion for the car mass would be 45 kilograms. As well as some other decisions that I think should be made. \n\nThe height of the initial drop should be 4-meters. I originally thought that it should be 5-meters. I thought this because the car needed to get through the entire roller coaster, and I didn't think it would with a 5-meter drop. To keep this roller coaster safe for the people who are riding it, the height needs to be 4-meters. When the drop height was at 5-meters, the speed at the bottom of the initial drop was 9.89 m/s, which is bigger than 8.4 m/s to keep everyone safe. There is a lot more potential energy when you have a higher initial drop, but we need to make sure that nobody gets hurt. When the height of the track was 2-meters, there were only 1079 joules of potential energy, but when I raised the drop height to 5-meters, there were 2697 joules of potential energy but the speed is too fast, and it will make it not safe for the people riding it if it was at 5-meters. If the height of the initial drop is higher then there is more potential energy that the car will convert into kinetic energy. \n\nThe height and mass effect potential, kinetic, and total energy as well. The more mass at the top of a higher hill means that there is more potential energy that can transfer to kinetic energy. If there is more potential energy, there is more total energy. This also has something to do with energy transfer and the law of conservation of energy. The law says that energy can't be created or destroyed but it can be switched between energys. When there is more total energy, that means that the potential and kinetic energy are added together. \n\nWhen I was learning about the mass and speed of the cart, I learned that the mass of the car doesn't affect speed. The speed will be the same no matter what the mass is. When the car was 40 kilograms, the speed at the top of the hill was 4.40 m/s and when the mass of the car was 60 kilograms, the speed was also 4.40 m/s at the top of the hill. \n\nThe higher the initial drop is the more potential energy there is. We learned in the simulation and collecting data that the mass doesn't affect the speed of the car. I chose the height of the initial drop of our roller coaster to be 4-meters, and the hill height to be 3-meters because if the hill height is bigger than the initial drop or the same height then the car can't go over. Also, the speed is something that is impacting my decision. The speed of the roller coaster can't be faster than 8.4 m/s. \n\nThe relationship between potential energy and kinetic energy is when the car is going down the track, all the potential energy that the car has will convert into kinetic energy. There is also energy transfer! The potential energy transfers into kinetic energy when the car is going down the hill. When friction is added some of this energy is transferred into energy that we call \"unusable energy\". Unusable energy is energy like sound and chemical energy. Also, the total energy is the potential energy and kinetic energy added up. The law of conservation of energy says that no energy can be created or destroyed, but it can switch from energy to energy. So if the total energy of the car at the end of the ride is less than what the starting potential energy is then that energy switches to other energy besides kinetic energy. Also, when the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy going down the drop, there is still the same amount of energy. When the car is going up the hill, the kinetic energy is converted into potential energy again, so it can do the same thing going down the hill. \n\nThe initial drop height and the hill height have to be different. When the initial drop height was 5 meters, and the hill height was 5 meters, the car couldn't get over the hill, but when the hill height was 2,3.5, and 4 meters, the car got over the hill perfectly. I think that the Gonzales Family has to have the highest hill that they can have that still allows the car to go over. I think this because there is more potential energy at the top of the hill. When the hill height was 2 meters, there were only 856 joules of potential energy at the top of the hill. When the hill height was 4 meters, there were 1663 joules of potential energy. The more potential energy the car has, the more kinetic energy there will be that is converted from potential energy as the car goes down the hill. \n\nThe mass of the car also matters. The mass needs to be lower so that car goes fast, and so that it can get over the hill. I think that the car mass should be 45 kilograms. I think this because when I was collecting data, the car mass was going slower when the car was at 60 kilograms. But when it was at 40 kilograms, the car was fast, and still had enough potential energy to get over the entire ride. The mass relates the potential energy and kinetic energy because if you have a higher mass then there is more potential energy that can convert into kinetic energy. If the car mass was 60 kilograms then there are 2937 joules of potential energy at the top of the initial drop, and when the car was at 40 kilograms, there were 1958 joules of potential energy. Also, if the car's mass was 45 kilograms then there will be more potential energy than what the car's mass of potential energy was at 40 kilograms. \n\nA lot of things have impacted my ideas one is what you should choose. Some of the most important things that have impacted it were the relationship between mass and speed, the relationship with drop heigh, and potential and kinetic energy. A lot of things have gone into this decision and I really hope all my research helped you and your family to create a safe roller coaster.

We made it so that its initial hill height would be high enough so the car can get over the hill and high enough so it can be safe and fast. The height of a 5 m. drop relates to PE at the top and KE at the bottom because How much PE you have at the top is going to be how much KE you have at the bottom because the energy transfers during the initial drop. Also if your height is more you're going to have more PE and KE but if it's less then you going to have less PE and KE. In one of my trials, my PE was 1173 J at the initial drop and my KE was 0. But after my initial drop, the KE was 1172 J and my PE was 1. So that showed me that the total energy was 1173 because you can't create or destroy energy but also that it can be transferred and it was. The 1173 j of PE transfers to KE after the initial drop. \n\nThe energy can transfer into different energy because of the Law of conservation of energy. The law of conservation of energy states that \"energy can't be created or destroyed but transferred\" and that's what happened the PE transferred into KE when going down the initial drop, but then transfers back to PE when it was on the top of the hill and then back to KE at the bottom of the hill. In order for the Roller coaster to go the whole way without stopping in the middle of the ride, we are going to have to figure out the relationship between height and hill height. \n\nIn our data, we saw that The initial drop height has to be higher than the hill height for it to keep going. So we had the initial height as 5m and the hill height as 4.5 m and it made it over the hill and stopped and the end. The initial drop height should be higher than the initial hill height because then the mass of the cart can get over the second hill without stopping. Mass affects PE and KE because if you at more mass on the rollercoaster the PE increases.\n\nAre initial height drop for the roller coaster is 3.75m and are mass is 50 kg. We chose are mass to be 50 kg because we thought it would be the perfect mass for the roller coaster. Are height for are initial drop is 3.75 and are hill height is 3.5 because we wanted the roller coaster to be a safe and fun ride. If it was over 3.75 for the initial height drop then the speed would be very unsafe so that's one of the first things we did. \nAre height and mass affected KE and not really affected PE. the mass was the same when it was frictionless Because there is no friction pulling against the rollercoaster car when it is moving. The height affects PE because they have a direct relationship so that means if the height increases the PE increases.\n \nThe mass didn't really affect speed because it was frictionless so the total speed at the end was the same. \nAlthough the initial height did. We had three trials and each was different with affecting speed. In the first trial, the initial drop height was 5 m and the speed got up to 9.89 J. Which would be very dangerous if it was a roller coaster. In the second trial, the speed was a little less than the first trial because the initial drop height was 4m and the speed was 8.83 which is still a little too fast for the riders to enjoy a ride. So the last trail we did we set the height to 3.75m and the speed was 8.54 which is alright because once we add the friction the speed will decrease and be a safe speed for the riders.

When the car is going down the initial drop, its potential energy diminishes and its kinetic energy increases. When the car is at the bottom of the initial drop, it has the most amount of kinetic energy. \n\nThe relationship between potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy is you combine the initial potential energy(PE=m*g*h) with the initial kinetic energy(KE=1/2*m*v^2), and that is how you get the initial total energy. When the roller coaster ride ends, the roller coaster has less total energy than when it started because some of its potential energy and kinetic energy turned into sound energy and thermal energy(which is caused by friction). \n\nWhen the car has a larger mass, it has more potential and kinetic energy than when it has a smaller mass. When the car mass was at 60kg, it had 2937J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop, and it had 2937J of kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop. When the initial drop height was at 5m and the hill height was at 4m, the roller coaster car was able to make it to the end of the roller coaster. When the car was at the top of the 5m initial drop, it had 2935J of potential energy and when the car was at the top of the 4m hill, it had 2351J of potential energy. The relationship between initial drop height and hill height is when the initial drop height is higher than your hill height, the car will have more potential energy that will turn into kinetic energy which will help keep the car in motion longer. \n\nThe initial drop height should be smaller than the initial drop because then the roller coaster car will be able to make it to the top of the hill and still have lots of potential energy. Potential Energy at the top and Kinetic Energy at the bottom are related because they are both forms of mechanical energy which help a roller coaster car be able to actually move. \n\nMy team's roller coaster will start off with an initial hill that it has to climb, so that way when it is released from the top, it has enough energy to be able to make it to the end of the roller coaster without having any help. I believe that we should have the initial drop(the initial hill) at our maximum height, so that way the car has enough kinetic and potential energy to make it to the end of the ride without any help of a chain or a push of some sort. I believe that we shouldn't have a certain mass because the mass doesn't really affect the speed of the roller coaster. I believe that we should have the initial drop at the max height and that we shouldn't have a very specific weight because if we have the initial drop at the maximum height, the car will have enough energy to make it to the end of the roller coaster with the help of friction slowing it down. When we had the car mass at 60kg, and the initial drop at 5m, we had enough mechanical energy to make it to the end of the ride(keep in mind though that this was in a frictionless test). \n\nHeight and mass affect the potential energy of a roller coaster because the higher the height is and the more mass you have, the more potential energy you will have. Height doesn't affect the kinetic energy because the time when you have the most kinetic energy is when you are at the bottom of the drop. Mass affects the kinetic energy of a roller coaster because the more mass you have and the more velocity, the more kinetic energy you will have.\n\nMass doesn't affect the velocity of a roller coaster because no matter what mass you have the car at, the speed will not be affected by it. Height affects the velocity of a roller coaster because the more height you have, the more potential energy you will have to change to kinetic energy. When the mass was at 40 and 60kg, the speed was the exact same even though the 40kg car was lighter than the 60kg car, the mass doesn't matter. When the initial drop height was 5m, the car had enough potential energy to make it to the end of the roller coaster.\n\nThe relationship between potential energy and kinetic energy is that they interchange with each other. Potential energy converts to kinetic energy and kinetic energy converts to potential energy. The relationship between potential energy and total energy is that whatever the initial potential energy is, that is the final total energy [in a frictionless area]. The relationship between kinetic energy and total energy is that whatever the kinetic energy is, it is always less than the total energy.\n\nThe Law of Conservation of Energy affects my design because the initial total energy won't be the same as the final total energy because some of the potential energy will convert to thermal energy, sound energy and other forms of non-useful energy's for a roller coaster to be able to move.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "70", "Raw": "82", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.6165", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.9404", "Comprehensive": "0.7785", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 11(3), 12(3), 14(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 22(2), 23(2), 27(2), 30(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 37(1), 39(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 6 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: ....................

Having the car start at 3.75m gives it the most PE. This will then turn into KE, which will keep the car going for the longest amount of time. Having lots of PE also helps because the Law of the Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be lost or destroyed, so having lots of PE will also help the car have lots of KE and momentum during the ride and after it ends. When the initial drop height was at 3m, there was 1762J of PE, and when the initial drop height was at 2m, there was 2932J of PE. Since energy cannot be lost or destroyed there, therefore, was more total energy in the 3.75m drop height. \n        I would also recommend for there to be a 3m hill inversion with the 3.75m drop height. The car needed enough KE to get over the 3m hill, and it did not have enough with the 5m hill. When we tested the hill height of 5m, at the top of the drop the PE was 2450 and at the top of the hill, the PE was 2425J and there was only 25J of KE left. This shows that the car does not have much KE or momentum since it has so much PE. But, when the hill height was 4m and the drop height was 5m, there was 513J of KE at the top of the hill, and this was plenty for the car to make it over the hill. \n        We would also recommend having a car that is 60kg. Through testing, we learned that at the initial drop, a car that was 50kg would have 2442J of PE, a car that was 40kg would have 1956J of PE, and a car that was 60kg would have the most PE of 2934J. We also learned that the amount of KE also followed similar trends in the number of Joules. There will always be 0J of KE at the top of the hill when the car is at rest, and since this is frictionless, there will always be 0J of PE at the bottom of the hills. In conclusion, we would recommend that your car is 60kg, your initial drop is 5m, and that your inversion is 4m. \n         We have chosen finally to have the initial drop height be 3.75m and the hill height be 3.5m. These heights would keep the ride safe yet fun.  We also chose for the mass of the car to be 50kg. Mass does not affect speed, because we are in a frictionless place, there is less air resistance that affects the car. When the car mass was 40kg the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.53m/s. When the mass was 60kg the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.53m/s.\n          Height on the other hand does affect speed. We found out that the higher height the more speed and the more total energy, a direct relationship. When the initial drop was 3.75m the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.54m/s. But when the drop height was 5m the speed at the bottom was 9.88m/s. \n          There also is no PE at the bottom of the hill while there is KE. There will be the same amount of total energy at the top and at the bottom.\n         To conclude, the Gonzales family should have a drop height of 3.75m and an inversion of 3m to keep their roller coaster safe yet fun.\n        ", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "32", "Raw": "24", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 98", "Quality": " 0.2449", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.2752", "Comprehensive": "0.2601", "Content Unit": "2(5), 7(4), 17(3), 18(3), 27(2), 32(2), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 54(1), 56(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 17 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... m.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3185f4d8ff4cc29cbf", "class_id": "1", "teacher_id": "JN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "The higher the initial drop height the more energy the car has throughout the ride. When the initial release height was at 3 meters the potential energy at the beginning of the track was 1624 joules, when the initial drop height increased to 5 meters the potential energy went up to 2707 joules. Similar data is shown when you look at the kinetic energy at the bottom of the ride. When the initial drop height it 3 meters the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop was 1623 joules, when it was increased to 5 meters the kinetic energy at the end of the drop was 2706 joules. These pieces of collected data show that when you have a higher initial drop height you have more energy. \nWhen we looked at the specific types of energy, we could see that potential and kinetic energy had a direct relationship to the total energy. Looking at our data, you can see that when the amount of kinetic energy was always very similar to the amount of potential energy. If the potential energy at the top of the drop was 2198 joules, the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2131 joules. Kinetic and potential energy also have a direct relationship to total energy and the law of conservation of energy. When the beginning PE was 1956 joules, and the KE at the bottom of the drop was 1947 joules, the total energy was 1956 joules. \nWhen the car is going down the drop, it can only have as much energy as the initial drop allows it to because according to the Law of Conservation of Energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed, which is why it's so important. If the initial drop allows your car to have a PE of 2445 joules, that is the only amount of energy it will have. The only thing that will change as the car is moving is what kind of energy it is. When you get to the bottom of the track the KE will be 2255 joules. This doesn't mean any energy was lost, it just means it is a different kind of energy, in this case, potential. As you are going down the track, the potential energy will go down and kinetic energy will go up the opposite amount. No energy is being created it is just transforming from one kind to the next. \nIf you want a hill, it cannot be higher than the initial drop. This is because in the experiments when we set the initial drop height to five and raised the hill height to five, the car did not make it over the hill. All other tests (initial drop height at 5 and hill height below) made it over the hill without friction.\nWhen the car had a mass of 40 kilograms the PE only reaches 1956 joules, and the KE only reaches 1947 joules. As we increased the mass of the car, it also increased the TE. When we set the car mass to 50 kilograms the PE reached 2445 joules, and the KE reached 2255 joules, with the TE reaching 2445 joules.\nBecause the height of the initial drop affects energy so much, it will also affect speed. This is because energy and speed have a direct relationship. In the data we've collected you can see how much height is connected to speed. When the initial drop height was 4.25 m the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.96 m/s, and although that is too fast for the safety of your passengers it will still provide an accurate example of how height changes speed. When we increased the height to 5 m the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.89 m/s. These patterns continue with the speed at the top of the hill and at the end of the ride. Most people would think that mass would affect the speed of the car, but through our experiments, we've found that it does not. This means that the mass of the car will not affect how fast it goes.\nMass and height have a direct relationship to KE, PE, and total energy. When the car mass started at 40 kg, the potential and total energy were 1956 joules, when I increased the mass to 50 kg the potential and total energy were 2445 joules. Similar patterns were shown when height was increased. If the height was 3 m, the potential and total energy were 1624 joules. When it was increased to 5 m the potential and total energy were 2707 joules. These patterns were identical to those of kinetic energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the data we've collected, I'd recommend a couple of things to make your roller coaster safe but fun. I would have the first thing you put in a hill so you can have the most energy to get it up the hill. The hill can be just smaller than the initial drop and still make it over. I would probably have the highest initial drop possible because that would give you the most total energy for the ride. I would have the car mass at 45 kilograms because a higher mass gives you more energy, but when you add friction it won't always make it over.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "74", "Raw": "66", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.4962", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7569", "Comprehensive": "0.6266", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 8(4), 11(3), 14(3), 17(3), 20(2), 24(2), 27(2), 28(2), 29(2), 31(2), 34(2), 35(2), 37(1), 38(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 51(1), 52(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 3": "Content Unit: 46 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... the potential energy went up to joules.\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 48 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... the kinetic energy at the end of the drop was joules.\n\t", "sentence 6 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 54 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... , we could see that potential and kinetic energy had a direct\n\t         .................... relationship to the total energy.\n\t", "sentence 7 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 20 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... when the amount of kinetic energy was always very similar to the\n\t         .................... amount of potential energy\n\t", "sentence 9 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 56 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3185f4d8ff4cc29cc2", "class_id": "1", "teacher_id": "JN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "The recommendation I would make to the Gonzales family about my roller coaster design is to keep the hill shorter than the initial drop. We have created a design with a 5-meter initial drop with a hill that is shorter than 5 meters. A hill of 4 meters. And with that, it can make it to the end of the ride without stopping. How? \n\nWell in order for the car to make it up the hill the car will need to have enough energy to make it up and down, which means that the release height has to be 5-meter. If you look at the data, the drop height or 4 meters had 2142 j of PE at the top. Where the height of 5 meters had higher potential energy of 2678 j. And with high potential energy, which is stored energy, it can be used to convert it into kinetic energy, which is the energy that an object has because of its motion as the car goes down. So the higher the drop the more potential energy the more kinetic energy at the bottom. And so as the car is going down the drop the potential energy of 2678 j at the top, and the kinetic energy of 0 j will convert to 1 j of potential energy at the bottom since it's still on the track and not on the actual ground, and the kinetic energy will be  2677 j at the bottom because it was in motion going down since kinetic energy measured the motion of an object. And as the car is going up the hill the kinetic energy will start to transfer to PE and as it reaches the top there will be all PE and 0 j of KE since it's at the top and not moving and as it goes down the hill the PE will transfer to KE going down. When the car is moving downhill car will use the stored energy and converts it to kinetic energy since it is in motion. And so the total energy will still be 2678 if you add the PE and KE at the end.\n\nThe potential energy at the start will always equal the total energy that is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy, where energy cannot be destroyed or created, only can transform into other energies. No energy is getting destroyed or any new created, only the PE converting to KE. So in order for the ride to be exciting, we added a hill, but the hill has to be shorter than the initial drop that is because there needs to be enough potential energy at the start of the drop to make up to the hill and down. If you look at the data, the car was able to make it up and down the hill with an initial drop of 5-meter and a hill height of 4-meter. The PE at the drop was 1958 j, and the PE at the top of the hill was 1569 j. But the car didn't make it through when the drop was the same and the hill of 5-meter. The PE at the top was still 1958 j, but the PE at the top was 1941 j. A lot more than the 4-meter hill. And if you see since the PE was so high it didn't have enough kinetic energy or speed to make it up the hill. Where the 4-meter hill could be because it had a lower PE and higher kinetic energy than the 5-meter hill so it was able to use the kinetic energy to make it up the hill. This is why the hill has to be shorter than the drop. And for it to be more exciting, the mass should be 60 kg, that is because the car will be able to go faster, than the other masses, which can make it more exciting. The data shows that the car with 40 kg had 2936 j of potential energy at the top, and1954 j of KE at the bottom, and the car with 60 kg had 2936 j of PE and 2931 j of KE. You can see that the car with more mass has greater kinetic energy and potential energy, meaning it had more energy to get down the hill.\n\nWe noticed in order for this ride to be exciting and safe, we cannot make the initial drop 5 meters, that is because, with the 5-meter initial drop, the speed at the bottom was 9.88 m/s which exceeds 8.4. And so we decided to go with the initial drop of 3.5 meters, where the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.27 m/s. The greater the height the greater the speed, in the data the drop with 3.5 meters had 8.27 m/s at the bottom, and if you increase the drop to 5 meters, the speed also increases to 9.88 m/s. Height and speed have a direct relationship, and so the higher the drop the higher the speed!\n\nThe mass of the car can really be any mass, from 40-60 kg, because the mass actually does not affect the speed! If you look at the data, the car with 40 kg had a speed of 9.88 m/s with an initial drop of 5 meters, and the car with 60 kg with the same drop also was 9.88 m/s. This shows that mass does not affect the speed, which is why we decided to just go with 60 kg for the mass. But why doesn't mass affect the speed? If both masses do not affect speed, that means both PE and KE have to be the same. In the equation, you can cancel out the mass, since both equations have the mass, and that leaves you with only height x gravity=velocity or speed. So mass actually has nothing to do with speed, where height and gravity determine the speed. Which explains how the higher the drop the more speed! And with more mass, there would be more PE and KE. Again, talking about the formula for both PE and KE, there is mass in both the equation. So if you increase the mass, the product would also increase! This is why if there is more mass, there would be more PE and which means more KE! But if there's more KE wouldn't it be faster? Well if there's more PE there's more KE but it doesn't mean it increasing the velocity but only the mass, so in the end it doesn't affect the speed.\n\nThe higher the drop the more PE and KE, because if you look at the equation for PE, PE=m x g x h. So the greater height in that equation the greater the product, and in this case PE. And with more PE, there would be more KE. And so the greater total energy, because again energy cannot be created nor destroyed, so if there is a greater amount PE at the beginning the total energy would be greater, the same with the PE at the beginning.\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "97", "Raw": "79", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.5940", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.9060", "Comprehensive": "0.7500", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 9(4), 10(3), 11(3), 14(3), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 27(2), 29(2), 31(2), 32(2), 33(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 42(1), 46(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

I learned that if the hill is equal to or greater than the height of the initial drop this can be seen in my data. When the height of the hill was 4m it was able the get over the hill whereas when the hill height was 5m it wasn't able to get over.\n\n Another thing I learned about is the law of conservation of energy. I learned that the amount of kinetic energy plus the amount of potential energy equals the amount of total energy. the law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but can be transformed.\n\nAnother thing I learned about is how the height of the initial affects the speed. I learned that the higher the initial drop the higher the speed this can be seen in my data when the height was 3m it had a speed of 7.65m/s whereas when it had a drop height of 5m it had a speed of 9.88m/s.\n\nAnother thing I learned about is how the weight of the car affects the speed. I learned that the speed will stay the same no matter what the weight is this can be seen in my data when the weight was 6kg it went 9.88m/s and when the weight was 4kg it went 9.88 m/s.\n\n Lastly, I learned about how the car mass affects the amount of potential energy. I learned that the greater the car mass was the more potential energy it had this can be seen in my data. When the car's mass was 60kg it had potential energy of 2937J whereas when it had a mass of 40kg it had potential energy of 1959J.\n\n In conclusion, I think you should be careful and think about these things when you are designing the roller coaster.\n\n Sinserly,\n    Jackson Maiers", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "38", "Raw": "52", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 108", "Quality": " 0.4815", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5963", "Comprehensive": "0.5389", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 11(3), 12(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 27(2), 32(2), 35(2), 38(1), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 55(1), 56(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 11 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... how the height of the initial drop affects the amount of potential\n\t         .................... energy\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

When the initial drop is higher there is more PE in the car to get the car to the end of the roller coaster, this is because of the law of conservation, the PE of the car at the top of the initial drop is the entire amount of energy for the car to get across the entire roller coaster, and that PE will only turn into KE, so no more energy can be created. So let's say you have When I had the initial drop height at 4.70 m the speed was 9.15 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop, at the top of the hill 6.55 m/s, and at the end of the ride, the speed was 9.57 m/s. For the lowest initial drop height, the height was 3.19. The speeds throughout the ride were 7.68 m/s, 3.63 m/s, and 7.88 m/s which is significantly lower than the 4.7 m even though the heights are only about a meter difference.The mass of the car doesn't impact the speed so it doesn't matter what mass you have the car at. If you want the car to have a higher speed then you want a larger height for the initial drop. When I had the initial drop height at 4.70 m the speed was 9.15 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop, at the top of the hill 6.55 m/s, and at the end of the ride, the speed was 9.57 m/s.

The speeds throughout the ride were 7.68 m/s, 3.63 m/s, and 7.88 m/s which is significantly lower than the 4.7 m even though the heights are only about a meter difference.

Because the law of conservation of energy indicates that energy cannot be generated or destroyed but can be altered, the total quantity of energy in both phases of the voyage was the same at 2445 J. Anything higher or equivalent to the initial drop will not work since the cart would be unable to overcome the hill. Because the energy is recovered by descending down the hill, there would be no limit to how many hills might be constructed. When the car weight was 60 kg, the pe was 2937, but when the vehicle weight was 40 kg, the pe was 1959j. When the car weight was 60 kg, the ke was 2932j, but when the car weight was 40 kg, the ke was 1912j. When the drop height was 2m, it went at a speed of 6.25m/s at the bottom, however, when the drop height was 5m, it went at a speed of 9.88m/s at the bottom.  Consider that the higher the initial drop, the more gravity is imposed on the car, giving it more energy and causing it to accelerate. In my data, the speed at the bottom of the drop was the same as the speed at the end of the trip, as evidenced by the fact that the 60kg car had a speed of 9.88m/s at the bottom of the drop and 9.88m/s at the end. Assume we have two automobiles, one with a force of 10N and the other with a force of 20N, both parked on top of frictionless 100m initial drops. We know that when there is no friction, the potential energy (PE) at the top of an initial drop is the same as the kinetic energy (KE) at the bottom because of the Law of Conservation of Energy.

We all know fast equals fun so here are some of my ideas on how to make your roller coasters more fun. These ideas include how to make your coasters faster. \n\nFirst for the initial drop this will give you the most potential energy. From tested data, the higher the initial drop is the more the potential energy there is. When the initial drop is at 5 the potential energy is 2447 while when the initial drop is 2 the potential energy is 976. Therefore you should have the highest initial drop as possible.\n\nNext, I think it would be best to have a medium hill because if the hill is too high the cart will not make it over because at the beginning total energy and potential energy will be the same and as it moves down the initial drop the potential energy will switch over to kinetic energy but the total energy will still be the same because of the law of conservation of energy which states that energy can not be created and destroyed. If the hill requires more total energy than the initial drop then it will not make it over because it will not have enough potential and kinetic energy. \n\nI think you should have a cart that has a higher mass because in my tested data it states. The higher the mass the higher the potential energy is. When the carts mass is at 60kg the potential energy was at 2937J. When my cars mass was at 40kg the potential energy was at 1958J. Also the more mass the more kinetic energy. When the car was at 40kg the kinetic energy was at 1948J. When the cart was at 60kg the kinetic energy was at 2862J. That is why I think you should have a heavier mass to have the fastest ride. \n\nI think you shouldn't change the mass of the cart because there is no change in the speed when having a heavier car. My data shows when the mass of the car was at 54kg, 60kg, 46kg, and 40kg the speed at the bottom of the drop was the same (9.89m/s), and the speed at the top of the hill was the same (6.97m/s), and the speed at the end of the ride was the same (9.88). This shows how the mass doesnt change the speed of the cart. I also think you should have a higher drop height. My data shows the higher the initial drop the more speed the car will have. When the initial drop height was at 5.00m the speed at the end of the ride is 9.88 m/s but when the initial drop height was at 3.00m the speed at the end of the ride is 7.65 m/s.\n\nThis is all the info I have to explain what changes you should make to your new ride to attract more customers. \nI explained all the changes to have maximum speed and potential energy as well as kinetic energy. It is also as safe as possible. \n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "47", "Raw": "61", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 117", "Quality": " 0.5214", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6995", "Comprehensive": "0.6105", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 11(3), 12(3), 13(3), 14(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 23(2), 25(2), 27(2), 32(2), 37(1), 40(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 57(1), 59(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 23 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... how to make the fastest roller coaster\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... how to make your roller coasters more fun\n\t", "sentence 5 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Here are the things so far that I know about roller coasters that you need. \n     You need to understand the relationship between the initial drop and how it relates to potential energy and kinetic energy. The higher the height of the initial drop the more potential energy at the top. When the release height was at 5.00m the potential energy at the top was 2443J and when the release height was at 2.00m the potential energy at the top was 977J. The potential energy of an object comes from its location at rest and moving the car up the hill causes the kinetic energy to decrease.\n     The relationship between potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy is important too. At the top of the initial drop, the potential energy is at its peak and the kinetic energy is at 0. The car will have kinetic energy on the way down the hill. When the cart gets to the bottom the kinetic energy will be at its peak and the potential energy will be low. This is because the law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed only transferred. The energy transfers from potential energy to kinetic energy. Potential energy and Kinetic energy are opposites. When the release height was at 5.00m the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was 2443J while the kinetic energy at the top of the initial drop was at 0J but the potential energy at the bottom of the initial drop was 8J while the kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop was 2436J. No matter the amount of potential energy and kinetic energy the total energy will always be the same. When the release height was at 5.00m the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was 2443J while the kinetic energy at the top of the initial drop was at 0J but the potential energy at the bottom of the initial drop was 8J while the kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop was 2436J. But while the potential energy and kinetic energy changed the total energy stayed the same. In the beginning, the Total energy was 2443J and the total energy was 2443J at the end. The whole time the total energy will be the same because the law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed only transferred. the energy here is being transferred from potential energy to kinetic energy.\n     The initial drop affects how much potential energy there is and the potential energy affects how much kinetic energy there is. The higher the initial drop the more potential energy at the top of the initial drop and the more kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop. When the release height was at 5.00m the potential energy was at 2443J and when the cart got to the bottom of the initial drop the kinetic energy was 2436J. But When the release height was at 2.00m the potential energy was at 977J and when the cart got to the bottom of the initial drop the kinetic energy was 970J. This is because the energy was transferred from potential energy to kinetic energy because of the law of conservation of energy.\n     When you add a hill to your roller coaster you need to make sure that the initial drop height should be higher than the hill height or else the cart will not make it over. When the initial drop was 5.00m we added a hill that was 2.00m, 3.00m, and 4.00m the cart made it over. This is because the initial drop had the most potential energy so it can make it over any hill that has less potential energy. when we added a hill that was 5.00m the cart did not make it over because they had the same amount of energy at the top of both the hill and initial drop and to be able to make it over the initial drop needs more energy than the hill does at the top.\n     The more mass your cart has the faster and farther your cart will go. The more Mass the more potential energy. When the Mass was 50kg the potential energy was 2448J and when the Mass was 60kg the potential energy was 2934J. Also The more Mass the more kinetic energy. When the Mass was 50kg the kinetic energy was 2444J and when the Mass was 60kg the kinetic energy was 2922J. \n     When you look at the drop height and speed the higher the initial drop the more speed the car will have. When the initial drop height was at 5.00m the speed at the end of the ride is 9.88 m/s but when the initial drop height was at 3.00m the speed at the end of the ride is 7.65 m/s. This is because the higher the height of the initial drop the more time the car has to drop because of gravity. Also the higher the height of the initial drop the more potential and kinetic energy.\n     Lastly when there is no friction no matter the mass of the cart the speed will always be the same. Because when the mass of the car was at 54kg, 60kg, 46kg, and 40kg the speed at the bottom of the drop was the same (9.89m/s), and the speed at the top of the hill was the same (6.97m/s), and the speed at the end of the ride was the same (9.88m/s). This is because Speed is caused by the amount of gravity and In this case, gravity and height are the same no matter the mass of the car since both cars are starting at the same drop height. This means the velocity is the same no matter the car's mass.\n     In conclusion, as you increase the initial drop height you increase the potential energy and kinetic energy in the roller coaster. Any hill or loop added must be a smaller height than the one before it so the cart can make it over. Also, the more mass the roller coaster car has the more energy the roller coaster will have. As you increase the initial drop height the more speed your roller coaster will have and as you increase or decrease the mass of the cart the speed will stay the same.\n\nI hope you design a great roller coaster Gonzales family. I hope this information helped you.\n-Jordan\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "59", "Raw": "77", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 129", "Quality": " 0.5969", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.8830", "Comprehensive": "0.7400", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 7(4), 9(4), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 13(3), 17(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 28(2), 32(2), 34(2), 37(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 23 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

This will make the roller coaster fun, and safe. \n\nMy first example I have collected in data starts with the initial drop, what I have observed is the higher the drop height, the more potential energy. This is collected from the release heights, when the release height was 5 meters the potential energy was 2443J while when the release height was 2m the potential energy was 977J. \nThis shows that with more potential energy at the initial drop the more kinetic energy it will have at the bottom of the track. When the release was 5m, the initial drop height was 2443 the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2436 while the release was 2m the potential energy was 977 at the top and at the bottom the kinetic energy was 973J. \n\nMy second example leading to why we should add certain features to the roller coaster is adding a hill. Energy was neither created nor destroyed. it just transferred from one to another.  I collected different data from adding various hills and changing the heights. What I have learned is that when adding on a hill to the track the hill must be a lower height then the initial drop in order to end the ride. When the  hill height is 5m the potential energy at the initial drop was 2449J and at the top of the hill it had 69J of kinetic energy which means the cart did not make it to the end of the ride because it didn't have enough energy. The rest of my data showed that when the hill height was lower then the initial drop it was able to make it to the end of the ride. \n\nMy third example is the importance of mass and energy, the more Mass the more potential energy. When the Mass was 50kg the potential energy was 2448J and when the mass was 60kg the potential energy was 2934J. which means a heavier cart will go faster/have more energy. \n\nAnother thing to think about is speed and how it relates to the drop height from my data I found the higher the initial drop the more speed the car will have. When the initial drop height was at 5.00m the speed at the end of the ride is 9.88 m/s but when the initial drop height was at 3.00m the speed at the end of the ride is 7.65 m/s.  The higher the height of the initial drop the more time the car has to drop because of gravity. Also the higher the height of the initial drop the more potential and kinetic energy. \n\nIn conclusion, the final roller coaster should have a bigger initial drop height then the hill in the roller coaster, and the more mass in the cart the more energy it will have. Increasing the drop height will increase the speed a finally the mass of the cart doesn't effect the speed. \n\n\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "42", "Raw": "42", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 112", "Quality": " 0.3750", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4817", "Comprehensive": "0.4283", "Content Unit": "3(5), 6(4), 11(3), 12(3), 13(3), 17(3), 18(3), 23(2), 27(2), 32(2), 33(2), 35(2), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 57(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

It will involve an initial drop of a hill and mass and energy.\n\nWe know that the higher the initial drop is the more potential energy there will be. And if there is more potential energy there will be more kinetic energy. And this will affect your ride because the potential energy will show how much energy will be on the ride. And the kinetic energy shows how much energy it has to boost the cart back up the hill as it goes downhill. And to show that this is true we have data to support it. In are initial height drop test we had are starting height at 5 meters and at the start its potential energy was 2443 and when it made it down the hill it's kinetic energy went 2440. Whereas are test starting at 2 meters only had 977 potential energy and 974 kinetic energy at the bottom. So this shows that the higher the initial drop the more energy the coaster will have. And this also relates to the law of conservation of energy, because the energy is not being destroyed or created it is being transformed.\n\nWe also found out that if the hill is at the same height as the initial drop the cart will not be able to get over the hill. And on every coaster the law of conservation of energy takes place. This means that the potential and kinetic energy can not be created or destroyed but can be transformed. This shows  And we also ran some tests with a hill height of 4 meters it will have 1937 potential energy at the top of the hill and have 508 kinetic energy. This shows how energy with the initial drop and hill all connect with each other.\n\nAlso, the more mass the cart has the more energy there will be. As shown in are data we had a cart mass of 60kg and it produced 2937 J. But in our test with a cart mass of 40kg, it only had 1959 J this shows that the more mass the cart has the more energy that will be produced for the ride.\n\nWe also have just found out that the mass of the cart will not affect the roller coaster in any way. This is because as long as there is gravity to move it down the hill it won't matter the mass. Even if it weighs more it will still go at the same speed. As seen in are data In a trial where the mass of the cart was 60 it had a speed of 9.88 at the end. And in are 40 mass cart trail it also had the same speed of 9.88 at the end.\n\nAnd we have also found out that the higher the initial drop height the more speed the roller coaster will have. As such in are trial in one of our trials we had a drop height of 5m and a hill height of 2.5m and when the ride ended the speed was 9.88m/s. Whereas in are 3m drop height with a 2.5m hill it had only 7.65m/s at the end.\nAnd this info shows that the higher the hill the more speed your roller coaster will have. This means you should have a taller in ital drop so that way the roller coaster will be faster.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "45", "Raw": "63", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 115", "Quality": " 0.5478", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7225", "Comprehensive": "0.6352", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 6(4), 7(4), 9(4), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 13(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 23(2), 27(2), 32(2), 35(2), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 6 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: ....................

I happen to be an 8th grade scientist that was told you needed help making a new and more fun roller coaster so here is my recommendation and the data I've been collecting to make it the best.\n\npotential energy= stored energy\nKinetic energy= energy of moment\nlaw of conservation of energy= that energy can not be created or destroyed it only can be transferred between potential energy and kinetic energy\n\nThe higher the height of the initial drop the more potential energy it starts off with. the start of height of 5.00 started with 2443.J of potential energy vs the release height of 2.00 which started at 977.J of potential energy. At the top of the initial drop it always starts with 0 Kinetic energy and a big number of Potential energy and at the end the Kinetic energy is bigger then the Potential energy like when the release height was 5.00 and the Kinetic energy was 0 and the Potential energy was 2443 and by the end the Kinetic energy was 2430 and the Potential energy was 13. The Potential energy is what it starts at and what it could move for and by the end it has used up all of its energy it could have and that's why at the beginning it has 0 stored energy or as its know as Kinetic energy and at the end it has a bigger number. Whatever the Potential energy is at the top is the amount of total energy it will have at the end. For example it could start with 4321 J of Potential energy and at the end it would have 4321 J of total energy.\n\nI started to realize that there is a relationship between kinetic and potential energy when it had the same total amount of energy at the end and beginning. For example,  I started at the initial drop with 2,448 potential energy and 0 Kinetic energy at the top of the hill i have 2086 potential energy and 362 Kinetic energy  and with the law of conservation of energy the potential energy and the Kinetic energy equal the total energy at all times because the energy can never be destroyed it only can be transferred, which is called the law of conservation of energy. The initial drop is the total energy at the beginning and at the higher hill there will be more energy then the total energy and when the hill is the same it will not go over because it will need more potential energy to get over the hill. The cart will make it to the end as long as the hill is smaller than the initial drop. there wouldn't be enough potential energy to make it over the hill if the hill is taller than the initial drop. The tallest hill has 0 potential energy and 2449 Kinetic energy at the top of the hill and the smallest hill has 979 potential energy and 1466 Kinetic energy at the top.\n\nThe higher the mass, the more potential energy and the less mass had less potential energy like at the top of the initial drop the 60.KG of mass had 2937.J of potential energy and the 40.KG of mass had 1958.J of potential energy. The higher amount of mass of the cart the more  Kinetic energy at the bottom such as the 60.KG or mass and the  Kinetic energy is  2925.J and the 40.KG of mass had 1955.J of  Kinetic energy. The more mass the more potential energy and the more that it transfers throughout the ride.\n\n\nThe cart that stared at 5.00 initial drop had 9.88 m/s speed at the end of the ride vs the cart that started at the 3.00 initial drop had 7.65 m/s speed at the end of the ride so if the the initial drop is higher the more speed their will be and more time to built up that speed. The higher the drop the more Kinetic energy and potential energy it will have and the more that gravity will pull down and it has more time to build up speed.\n\n The speed i recorded  was the same no matter how much the cart weight was. The mass doesn't matter when there is no friction everything weighs the same with no friction. If i drop a feather and a brick and there is no friction they will hit the ground at the same rate. If i drop a whale and feather with no friction they will hit the ground at the same time because if there is no friction they weigh the same and will fall at the same rate. \n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "13", "Raw": "15", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 53", "Quality": " 0.2830", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.1720", "Comprehensive": "0.2275", "Content Unit": "6(4), 11(3), 20(2), 40(1), 50(1), 51(1), 54(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 40 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

I am going to help you design a rollercoaster that is great. the ride I think would be the best to remcomemend a rollercoaster with a lot of hills and lots of speed. and you have to remember that the law of conservation for energy can not be created or destoryed it can only be transformed.\n\nwhen making a rollercoaster the first thing that I learned is that on the intial drop the potential energy is whatever it is and the kintetic energy is 0. From my expirement and the data I got on it the potential energy was 2440 at the top and the kintetic energy was 0. and at the bottom of the intital drop the potential energy was at 5 and the kinetic energy was at 2435. whatever your potential energy and kinetic energy is the 2 of those added togdther always equal the total energy.\n\nIf you decide to add a couple hills to this ride you have to make sure that the hills are lower than eachother one after another because if you look at my data the potential energy starts on 2444 J and kinetic energy is 0 J so the total energy is 2444 J so when the cart is in motion the potential energy leaves it because that is stored energy and kinetic energy is going into it. so if it is bigger than the initial drop the kinteitc neergy will be higher than it should be. an example is that if the kinetic energy is at 2440 J and the Potential energy is at 30 J that does not eqaul the total energy 2444 anymore so that wouldn't work because PE plus KE should alsways equal the total energy. \n\nWith mass and energy you have to make sure that your car is light enough to go over hills but you also have to make sure that it's not to light so it doesn't go flying off the track. In my data it shows that the more mass the car has the higher the potential energy is. as you can see from my data when the car was 60 kg it has 2937 Potential energy but when it had 45 kg it had 2214 Potential energy. The more the mass the more kinetic energy there will be at the bottom. as you can see from the data it said that when the car had 60 kg it had 2909 J Kinetic energy at the bottom fo the hill but when it was 45 kg it had 2192 J kinetic energy.\n\nwhen you make your rollercoaster you have to make sure that if you want the rollercoaster to go fast you need to put the inital ldrop height higher. as you may see from my data when i put the inital drop height at 5.00 m by the bottom of the drop the speed was 9.78 m/s but when I had the height at 4.00 m the speed at the end of the inital drop was 8.57 m/s so as you may see that when I put the height higher the rollercoaster went faster. this is because the cart had more distance to gain speed and go faster.\n\nif you're worried about the mass of the cart and how that would stop the speed it doesn't. when you change the mass the speed stays the exact same. as you can see from my data when I had the cart be 60 kg the end speed was 9.88 m/s and when I changed the mass to 45 kg the speed at the end was also 9.88. this is because with no friction there is no force holding one back or pushing one forward more. but if you did have friction it would matter because it would have a force on it slowing it down. but if there is no friction it doesn't matter how heavy you make your cart.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "21", "Raw": "30", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 76", "Quality": " 0.3947", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3440", "Comprehensive": "0.3694", "Content Unit": "2(5), 4(4), 9(4), 12(3), 20(2), 32(2), 35(2), 44(1), 46(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 59 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Like at the top of the initial drop it is all potential energy and at the bottom of the drop the more kinetic energy. Like in our teams experiments the drop that was 5m tall had 2443 Potential energy at the top but the drop  that was 2m tall only had 977.But we also discovered the higher initial drop the more speed because if the initial drop height is 5m it has 9.88m/s at the end of the roller coaster but if the height of the drop is only 2m its speed at the end is 6.25m/s.\n\nMe and my team has also discovered that the hill after the initial drop cannot be higher than the initial drop and if it is the roller coaster can make it over the hill witch is unsafe. We also found out that a hill with the height of 4m has a higher potential energy at the top of a hill witch is 2449 but a hill with a height of 2 only had 1478 potential energy. So the higher the hill the more potential energy at the top of it but not too high or the coaster cant make it over the hill.\n\nWe also found that the more mass the cart has the more energy in total it has in our experiments we found that a car that weights 60kg had 2937J of total energy but a car with a mass of 40 only had 1959J of total energy. But with further research mass dose not affect speed because a car with a mass of 60kg had 9.88m/s at the end of the ride but a car with the mass of 40kg also had 9.88m/s therefore mass dose not affect speed but it dose affect the total energy.\n\nAbout the roller coaster me and my team would recommend a tall initial drop so the roller coaster gets plenty of speed and energy. Also have a hill after the drop but it cant be the same height as the initial drop or it wont make it over same with loops i would recommend a heavy car so it gets plenty of energy but don't worry as long as you make the car arrow dynamic the speed wont get affect by the car.\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nCJ and The science team\n\n \n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "31", "Raw": "36", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 96", "Quality": " 0.3750", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4128", "Comprehensive": "0.3939", "Content Unit": "3(5), 6(4), 11(3), 17(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 32(2), 35(2), 42(1), 46(1), 47(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Let us say that the mass of a cart was 50kg. When it starts from 5.00m it has 2,443j of potential energy. When it starts from 2.00m it has 977j of potential energy. Before the cart goes it has zero kinetic energy but it has potential energy. For example drop one started with 2,443j of potential energy and 0j of kinetic energy. The kinetic energy increased and the potential energy decreased when the cart traveled.\nSecondly the potential energy at the top of the hill cannot exceed that of the potential energy created by the initial drop. For example: if the potential energy at the initial drop is 1,228j and the hill exceeds that it can't make it over the incline because extra energy can't be created out of nowhere due to the law of conservation of energy. The initial drop must be higher than the hills. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only change form. You can also have multiple hills as long as they don't exceed the amount of potential energy created by the initial drop.\nThirdly the more mass something has the more potential energy it has. A cart with 40kg of mass has 978j of potential energy. A cart with 60kg of mass has 1468j of potential energy. And the more mass something has the more kinetic energy it can produce. A cart with 40kg of mass can reach 971j of kinetic energy and a cart with 60kg of mass can reach 1463j of kinetic energy. the speed that the car reaches should not go over 160 mph. the mass of the car has no effect on the speed that the car reaches, the height that it falls from does. when the initial drop was at 5m the carts all had a speed around 9.88 m/s regardless of mass.

You need a high initial drop height, a hill shorter than the initial drop, and a cart with a higher mass because the Data trials showed that The Higher the Mass, the more total energy it has.  This is good because it will make the cart go over the hill. This is shown in the data when the mass of the car was 60kg, the Potential was 2836j.\n     I would also tell the Gonzales family that the hills cannot be higher than the initial drop point so their idea is impossible. This showed in my data when the hill height was 5meter and the initial drop was also 5, the cart did not go over the hill. The initial drop height should be higher than the hill height. No matter what the total energy is always going to be the same because the law of conservation of energy says that energy can not be made or destroyed it can only be transferred. There will always be more potential energy at the top of the hill than the kinetic energy so that the cart can make it over the hill. The potential energy at the top is always going to be higher than the kinetic energy at the top and the kinetic energy at the bottom is going to be higher than the Potential energy at the bottom\n       The higher the height of the initial drop point, the more potential energy the cart has because when the initial drop point was 5.00m, the potential energy was 2443j but when the release height was 2.50 m the potential energy was 1222j.\n   The greater the initial drop, the higher the speed. This was shown in the data when the initial drop was 5 meters and the speed was 9.88m/s compared to when the initial drop was 3.5meters and the speed was 8.26m/s. This happens because the higher you are up the faster gravity will pull you down.\n    Mass does not affect speed but does affect the energy an object has. the higher the mass, the more energy it will have. Mass only determines how fast the energy will change from KE to PE and vice versa. This was shown in my data trial when the mass of the car was 50kg, the speed was 9.88m/s and when the mass of the car was 60kg, the speed was still the same at 9.88m/s. \n In conclusion, the Gonzales roller coaster needs to have a high initial drop, a hill height shorter than the initial drop, and high mass.\nSincerely,\nShilla Arindwa", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "35", "Raw": "47", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 104", "Quality": " 0.4519", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5390", "Comprehensive": "0.4955", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 10(3), 11(3), 15(3), 17(3), 19(3), 27(2), 28(2), 34(2), 35(2), 42(1), 46(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

So if the initial drop is 5 meters high the speed will be 9.88 (m/s) at the bottom and as it climbs the hill the speed will be at 6.98 (m/s) and at the end of the ride the speed will be at 9.88 (m/s). And if the initial drop is 3 meters then the speed will be at 7.66 (m/s) and as it climbs the hill the speed will be at 3.09 (m/s) at the top of the hill and at the end of the ride it will be 7.65 (m/s).\n\nIn my data the mass of the cart will not effect the speed of the roller coaster cart. So if the mass of the cart is 60 (kg) the speed at the bottom of the drop will be 9.88 (m/s) and as it climbs the hill the speed at the top of the hill will be at 6.97 (m/s) and at the end of the ride the speed will be at 9.88 (m/s). And if the mass of the cart is 54 (kg) the speed at the bottom of the drop will be 9.86 (m/s) and as it climbs the hill the speed at the top of the hill will be at 6.97 (m/s) and at the end of the ride the speed will be at 9.88 (m/s).\n\nSo in the end when you build a roller coaster based of the data i collected the initial drop height will be really important and if it is high then you can put some small hills and each hill will need to be smaller then each other.And the mass will not play a factor in the speed of the cart so it can weigh whatever works for your plans of the build.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "42", "Raw": "46", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 112", "Quality": " 0.4107", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5275", "Comprehensive": "0.4691", "Content Unit": "3(5), 10(3), 12(3), 14(3), 15(3), 16(3), 17(3), 19(3), 20(2), 27(2), 29(2), 32(2), 35(2), 38(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 3 [Weight: 5]\n\tSegment: ....................

This is true because of my trials, in a trial of mine the release height was 4 meters and had the higher potential energy and kinetic energy compared to the trials with lower release heights. A high amount of energy is important because it will help the cart go over the hill. \n       A hill that is shorter than the initial drop height is important because if the initial drop height and the hill height are equal or the hill height is higher then the cart will not go over. It will not go over because there is not enough energy for the cart to go over. This is true because in a trial of mine where the hill height was 5 meters and the initial drop was also 5 meters and the cart did not go over. Throughout the whole ride, there will always be the same amount of total energy. This is because the law of conservation of energy says energy can not be destroyed nor created only converted but there has to be more potential energy than kinetic energy at the top of the hill so the cart can get over. The potential energy at the top of the hill will be more than the kinetic energy because the car is at a somewhat stop. The kinetic energy will be higher than the potential energy at the bottom because the energy converts between potential and kinetic.\n       A high amount of mass in the cart is also important because the higher the mass of the cart the more energy there will be. This is true because in a trial of mine when the mass of the car was 60kg and the potential energy was 2836 but in a trial with 40kg as the car mass the potential energy was 1958. More energy is a good attribute because more energy will push the cart over the hill. \n       A high initial drop height is important because it will increase the speed. This is true because in my data a trial with an initial drop height of 3.5 m had a speed at the bottom of the drop of 8.26 m/s but a trial with an initial drop height of 5 m had a speed at the bottom of the drop of 9.88 m/s. This proves that a high initial drop height is important if you want to have a roller coaster with a lot of speed.\n       The understanding of the relationship between mass and speed is important because you need to understand that the larger mass affects the energy but not the speed. A high mass will have a high energy meaning that a roller coaster with a high mass will have more potential energy and kinetic energy. A high mass will not affect the speed of the roller coaster. This is true because in my trials I had a mass of 40 kg and the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.89 m/s, the speed at the top of the hill was 7.00 m/s, and the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88 m/s. My trial with a cart that weight 40 kg had the same exact numbers meaning that mass does not affect speed. \n       In conclusion, an initial drop is valuable because depending on the height there will be more kinetic energy and potential energy, a hill that is shorter than the initial drop height is important because if the initial drop height and the hill height are equal or the hill height is higher then the cart will not go over, the more mass of a cart the more energy there will be, a higher initial drop height increases the speed, and mass does not affect speed.\n       Sincerely, Gabriella Jensen", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "47", "Raw": "61", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 117", "Quality": " 0.5214", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6995", "Comprehensive": "0.6105", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 3(5), 9(4), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 13(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 3 [Weight: 5]\n\tSegment: ....................

An initial drop height of 3.5m would create more potential energy than a lower initial drop height and is safer than a higher initial drop height. When there is more potential energy, the total energy will be higher causing the cart to have the chance to get over a higher hill. A 3.5m initial drop height would also be a safe speed if the initial drop height is above 3.5m it could be unsafe since the initial drop height directly effects the speed. The speed should be between 6.7m/s to 8.4m/s in order to be enjoyable but safe.\n\nThe mass does not effect the speed without friction.

And to keep having kinetic energy to keep the car moving the whole time you will need hills. And consider the mass of the roller coaster car and how much energy it will have. The drop height and speed. Mass and speed\n\nIn my research, I found that the height of the initial drop affected the amount of potential energy and kinetic energy a roller coaster car would have. The data showed that when the height of the initial drop was 5meters tall it would have 2443 J of potential energy at the top of the drop. Then, it would have 2624 J of kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop. But when the height of the initial drop was 2 meters it had 1055 J of potential energy at the top of the drop. when it got to the bottom of the initial drop it had 1036 J of kinetic energy. This shows the law of conservation energy because each number of potential energy and kinetic energy never went above the amount of total energy and both shifted the amount to equal out.\n\nAlso in my research, I found that the height of the hill affected if the car could make it to the end. The data showed in this study that if a hill was the height of the initial drop both at 5 meters it could not make it to the end. But when the hill height was 4m and the initial drop was 5m it would make it to the end.\n\nAnother thing I researched in my study was, how the car's mass affected its amount of energy.  In my data, the initial drop was always 5 meters for this study. one car's mass was 60 kg and it had 2937 J of potential energy\nat the top of the initial drop. The mass of Another car that I used was 40 kg and it only had 1958 J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop. So more mass meant more potential energy and kinetic energy. \n \nThe next thing I researched was the initial drop height and the height of the hill and how it affects the speed of the roller coaster. In my data, I first set the hill height at 2.5 m and the car mass at 54kg I did this because these would not change throughout the study. But my first initial drop height was 5m and at the end of the, there would be a speed of 9.88 m/s.I also tried the initial drop height at 3.5m and it had a speed of 8.27 m/s at the end of the ride. so this means you want a taller initial drop to have more speed.\n\nThe last thing I researched was how the car/ cart mass affected speed. I set the initial drop at 5 m and the hill height at 4.5m those would not change. My first trial would have a car/cart mass of 60kg at the end of the ride it would have a speed of 9.88 m/s. I also tried a car/cart with a mass of 45kg at the end it would end up having the same amount of speed as a 60 kg car would at 9.88m/s. This means the mass of the car does not affect the speed of the car.\n\nIn conclusion, my research showed that you need a higher initial drop to get more energy. But you never can have a higher hill than the initial drop and a hill can never be taller than the hill that came before it. You want a higher mass for your roller coaster car to get more energy. You also need a taller initial drop to have more speed . But one thing that does not affect speed is the mass of the car.\n\nsincerely, Carsen", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "54", "Raw": "48", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 124", "Quality": " 0.3871", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5505", "Comprehensive": "0.4688", "Content Unit": "3(5), 6(4), 7(4), 13(3), 14(3), 15(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 23(2), 27(2), 35(2), 42(1), 44(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The taller the initial drop height the more potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy. This is good for the roller coaster because it has the roller coaster have more total energy. In my data when I put the initial drop height at 2m the total amount of energy was 985J but when I put the initial drop height at 5m the total energy was 2463J. This proves that the taller the drop the roller coaster will make it go to the end. \n     Although it would be fun to have a hill taller than the initial drop, it is not possible to have the hill be taller or the same size as the initial drop because the car will not be able to make it over the hill. This shows in my data on a trial of mine where the hill height was 5 meters and the initial drop was also 5 meters and the cart did not go over the hill. Throughout the whole ride, there will always be the same amount of total energy. This is because the law of conservation says that energy is created or destroyed only converted, but there has to be more potential energy rather than kinetic energy at the top of the hill so the cart can go over. When you are at the top of the hill there will be no kinetic energy but a lot of potential energy because the car is slowed to a near stop. And at the bottom of the hill, the kinetic energy will be higher number and the potential energy will be low because the cart is moving. \n     You will also need a cart with a high amount of mass. The more mass there is the more potential energy there will be. This is shown in our trial when we had the cart mass at 60kg and the top of the hill, there was a total of 2934 potential energy. When we had the cart mass at 40kg the cart had a total of 1956J potential energy at the top of the hill. this is also seen with potential energy. The more mass there is the more kinetic energy there will be. This is shown in our trial when we had the cart mass at 60kg and the bottom of the hill, there was a total of 2932 kinetic energy. When we had the cart mass at 40kg the cart had a total of 1955J kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill. \n     Another thing you need is a tall initial drop so that the speed is as fast as it can go. This is shown in our data when we had an initial drop at 5.00m and the speed at the bottom of the initial drop was 9.88 m/s. When we put the initial drop at 2.55m the speed at the bottom of the initial drop was 7.07 m/s. This proves that you need a tall initial drop for greater speed but not too tall to where the roller coaster becomes dangerous. \n     Lastly, you will need to know the mass of the cars. In our data mass does not affect the speed of the car. It only affects the potential energy and the kinetic energy. When the mass of the car was 60kg the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88 m/s. And when the mass of the car was 40kg the speed of the car at the end of the ride was 9.88 m/s. Even though the mass does not affect the speed that doesn't mean that it is not important. You still need to know the mass for other parts of the roller coaster. \n     In conclusion, if you want to build a successful roller coaster here are the things you need to have an initial drop height of 5m, a hill shorter than the drop, and a cart with a high amount of mass, you need a high initial drop to increase the speed, and you need to know the mass so you know the right amount of energy needed. \n\nSincerely, \n   Kailyn Holloway ", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "56", "Raw": "68", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 126", "Quality": " 0.5397", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7798", "Comprehensive": "0.6597", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 13(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 28(2), 29(2), 32(2), 33(2), 35(2), 37(1), 42(1), 46(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 29 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... and you need to know the mass.\n\t", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 10 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: ....................

The potential energy at the bottom of the hill is smaller than the potential energy at the initial drop and the kinetic energy is higher on the hill rather than the initial drop.

For example in one of our tests when the hill height was 2 meters the potential energy at the top of the hill is 2347 and the kinetic energy was 0 so you would add them together and that equals the total energy. Another example is when we had it a 5 meters tall, the potential energy at the Initial drop was 2351 and the kinetic energy was 0 so add it up and it equals the total energy. Also the more mass the cart has the more total energy.

An Initial drop height, a hill that is shorter than the initial drop, a car with a lot of mass, a tall initial drop so there is more speed, and you need to know the mass.\n\n     The first thing you need is an initial drop. The taller the initial height the more potential, kinetic, and total energy the roller coaster will have. This is shown when we tested our roller coaster and we set the initial drop height at 5.00m and the total energy was 2463 J. When we set our initial drop height at 2.00m the total amount of energy was 985 J. \n\n      The second thing you need is a hill that shorter than the initial drop. This is shown in my data on a trial of mine where the hill height was 5.00m and the initial height was also 5.00m. The cart did not go over. When I tried again with the initial drop still at 5.00m and the hill height at 4.01m the cart made it over. When I did this over and over again with the hill height being shorter than the initial drop height the roller coaster kept making it to the end. Throughout the whole ride, there will always be the same amount of total energy. This is because the Law of Conservation of Energy says energy can not be destroyed nor created only converted. But there has to be more potential energy rather than kinetic energy at the top of the hill so the cart can get over. When you are at the top of the hill there is going to be more potential energy rather than kinetic energy because the car is at a somewhat stop. When the car starts moving down the hill there will be more kinetic energy rather than potential energy because the car is moving. \n\n     The third thing you need is a car with a lot of mass so there is more energy. This is shown in our trial when we had the cart mass at 60kg and at the top of the hill, there was a total of 2934 J potential energy. When we had the cart mass at 40 kg the cart had a total of 1956J at the top of the hill. This is also shown in my trial with kinetic energy. We had the cart mass at 60kg and at the bottom of the hill, there was a total of 2932 J kinetic energy. When we had the cart mass at 40 kg the cart had a total of 1955 J kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill. \n\n     The fourth thing you need is a tall initial drop so your roller coaster has a lot of speed. This is shown in our data when we had our initial drop height set at 5.00m and the speed at the bottom of the initial drop was 9.88 m/s. When we had our initial drop height set at 2.55m the speed at the bottom of the drop was 7.07 m/s. So you need to set your initial drop high so you have a lot of speed but not too high to the point where your roller coaster becomes dangerous. \n\n     The last thing you need is to know the mass of your car. In our data, it shows up that the mass doesn't affect the speed. In all 4 of my trials, the numbers stayed the same. I kept changing the mass of my car but I would end up with 9.89 m/s at the bottom of the drop, 6.98 m/s at the top of the hill, and 9.88 m/s at the end of the ride every time. Just because the mass doesn't affect the speed it does affect other things. You still need to know the mass so you can control the amount of energy because you can't have too much mass because you want just the right amount of energy. \n\n     In conclusion, if you want to build a good roller coaster you need an initial drop that is tall so you have a lot of speed but not too tall where it's dangerous, a hill that is shorter than your initial drop,  a car with a lot of mass, and a good mass for your car so you get the correct energy. \n\nSincerly, \nBrianna Rusch ", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "67", "Raw": "55", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.4135", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6307", "Comprehensive": "0.5221", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 7(4), 11(3), 13(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 28(2), 29(2), 34(2), 35(2), 37(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 3 [Weight: 5]\n\tSegment: ....................

If the roller coaster has a hill, you will need to make sure the hill height is lower than the drop height because otherwise it wont make it past the hill and wont get to the end of the ride. During the initial drop when the roller coaster is released the total energy stays the same because of the Law of Conservation of Energy which states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transferred, so when the roller coaster cart is released from the initial drop, all of the potential energy converts to kinetic energy. If a cart has a lot of mass, it will have more potential, kinetic, and total energy because its heavier than the other carts. For example, in test 2 of experiment 4, the cars mass was 60 and it has a total energy of 2937 J, a potential energy of 2937 J and a kinetic energy of 2925 J . Another test we did was a car with a mass of 40, that cars total energy was 1958 J it had a potential energy of 1958 J and it had a kinetic energy of 1955 J. To have the best roller coaster with the most speed and the most fun you will want an initial drop with a height of 5 m and a hill height of 2.5 m, you will also want to make sure that yours cart has a mass of 60, this will all make the fastest ride and the most fun. A cart with a high mass wont affect speed but it will affect potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy, however the height of the potential drop affects the speed and the total energy.\n\nThis is all a great idea for a roller coaster that if put together correctly would be fast, fun, and sure to attract a bunch of customers.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "24", "Raw": "48", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 82", "Quality": " 0.5854", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5505", "Comprehensive": "0.5679", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 9(4), 13(3), 14(3), 16(3), 20(2), 27(2), 29(2), 35(2), 42(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 9 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: ....................

My team's roller coaster design will be exciting and make it to the end of the ride without stopping. On this roller coaster, the initial drop height would be 5.00 (m). This has proven to be the most exciting and fast roller coaster because of the height of the initial drop. At the top of this drop, the potential energy is 2448(J), while the kinetic energy is 0(J), but as the roller coaster goes down the drop, the kinetic energy gets higher while the potential energy gets lower. If you make the initial drop height 5.00(m), it will make the potential energy and kinetic energy change in numbers very quickly, meaning that the drop is a very steep drop that goes straight down. This initial drop height would also be beneficial for the rest of the ride. Since this ride is going to run simply off of gravity, the ride would start at the highest point, and begin with the initial drop. this would give the cart. enough energy to make it to the end of the ride without stopping. Another idea to make this ride exciting would be to add a hill. With our experimenting, we have learned that the height of the hill cannot be the same height or taller than the initial drop, or the cart will not have enough energy to make it over the hill and finish the ride. For example, if the initial drop height is 4.00(m), and the hill height is 5.00, the car would not make it to the end of the ride because it does not have enough power to go over the hill. If your initial drop height is 5.00(m), a good height for your hill would be around 4.00(m) or under. Potential energy, kinetic energy and total energy, are all connected throughout the ride. If the height is 5.00(m) vs. 2.00(m), the potential energy at the top of the initial drop is going to be higher rather than lower. It works the same way for the kinetic energy, if the height is 5.00, the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop is going to be higher rather than lower. The law of conservation of energy says that energy cannot be destroyed, nor created, which would be an example of a controlled variable. For a higher total speed for your roller coaster, the initial drop height needs to be higher than all the other drops, and at a higher point rather than lower. For example, if the drop height is at 5.00(m), the speed will be at 9.88(m/s) at the bottom of the drop and end of the ride, and 6.98(m/s) at the top of the hill. But if the initial drop height is 3.24(m) the speed at the bottom of the drop and the end of the ride will both be 7.96(m/s), while the speed at the top of the hill is 3.78. The relationship between the mass of the car and the speed of the ride is an example of The Law of Conservation of Energy because the energy is not destroyed nor created no matter the mass of the car. It stays the same throughout the whole ride.

The law of conservation of energy says that the amount of energy cannot change in a stationary object but it can shift around, for example the amount of potential energy when an object is not moving can be transferred to kinetic energy when it is moving. We also know that it will make it to the end because when we did our tests on a track with an initial drop height of 5 meters and a hill height of 4 meters it had 2448 J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop and it had 1966 J of potential energy at the top of the hill as well as 482 J of kinetic energy at the top of the hill. When we did this test the initial drop had more total J of energy than the hill so it was able to make it over the hill. We know the roller coaster will not stop because it has enough total J of energy to make it to the end while still being safe and fun. \n\n          If we make the car heavier to 60 kg it will give the car more energy because it can go downhill faster because it is heavier and can fall easier and faster. For example, in our test with the cars mass when we did our test with a car that has a mass of 60 kg it had a total amount of energy of 2936 J while a car with a mass of 40 kg only had a total energy of 1957 J, almost 1000 J of energy less. This evidence shows that a heavier car will make it go faster and have more energy to make it up hills. When the car goes down the initial drop it will gain a lot of speed until it reaches the bottom where it will slow down when it is making its way up the hill but it will add another drop and more speed after the top of the hill when it goes down, this makes it a lot more fun because roller coasters are fun when they have more speed and hills. \n\n          When the car makes it to the bottom of the initial drop or the hill it will have a lot of kinetic energy because it is going fast and it will have more potential energy at the top of the hill and initial drop because it is slower. Also the hill will be higher because the higher the hill the more total amount of energy it will have. For example, a roller coaster with a height of 5 meters had 2444 total J of energy while a drop that was 2 meters high only had 977 total J of energy. Therefore it should be high because the more energy you have the faster it can go and the better chance it has to make it to the end. \n\n          The initial drop needs to be tall because it gives the car more speed the taller the drop. For example when we tested initial drop heights and speed an initial drop with a height of 5 meters had 9.8 m/s of speed at the end of the ride while an initial drop that was only 2.25 meters high had just 6.63 m/s of speed at the end. This evidence shows that if the initial drop is higher it will give the car more speed and if the roller coaster is really fast a lot of people will want to ride it more. The mass of the car does not effect the speed but it does effect the amount of energy so the heavier the better, also if the material is more durable and effective you will want to use that since it wont effect the speed. For example when we tested the weight of the cars a car with a weight of 60 kg had a total 9.88 m/s of speed at the end of the ride and a car with a total weight of 40 kg had a total 9.88 m/s of speed at the end of the ride which is the same speed as the heavier car. This shows that the weight does not effect the speed, the weight also does not effect the speed because the mass does not change the velocity.\n\n          With all this evidence our roller coaster would be very effective because it is very tall to make the passengers have a better time because the drop will be the main factor of attraction to the ride and it will be very fast because of the height and the hill and loop will add a more exciting ride at make it a little longer.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "57", "Raw": "58", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 127", "Quality": " 0.4567", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6651", "Comprehensive": "0.5609", "Content Unit": "0(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 9(4), 15(3), 17(3), 19(3), 23(2), 27(2), 28(2), 29(2), 32(2), 35(2), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 32 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

In order to have the max amount of speed possible, you need the highest amount of kinetic energy. This will mean you need the max amount of potential energy when you are at the top of the initial drop. For this, you will need the highest drop you can get. This was proven when we had a drop of 4 meters it had 1955 J of potential energy, but when we raised the height to a 5-meter drop, it had 2443 J of potential energy. Now, potential energy is the amount of energy stored in a stationary object. Kinetic energy is the amount of energy in a moving object. Therefore we want the most amount of Kinetic energy possible when we're going down the hill. Once again for this, we need the max height we can get. This is proven when we had the 4-meter drop we had 1954 J of kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill, but once again when we raised it to a 5-meter drop, the kinetic energy raised up to 2443 J of kinetic energy. \n\nOnce again, a good roller coaster has hills in it. But, if you don't have enough speed going into these hills, you won't be able to get over them. Because when an object starts moving the potential energy starts getting tuned into kinetic energy. When the object begins losing momentum, kinetic energy is converted back into potential energy. No matter what, there is always the same amount of energy in an object. This is what's called the Law of Conservation of Energy. When a car is sent down the hill the kinetic energy build back up. But when it begins to go back up the hill, the kinetic energy starts to run out turning back into potential energy. Therefore if the hill is equal to or taller than the initial drop, the car won't be able to make it back over. This is proven when we had a drop of 5-meters and a hill height of 5-meters, the car was never able to make it over. But when we dropped the hill height down to 4-meters the car still had 506 J of kinetic energy by the top of the hill, which made it able to get over the hill itself. \n\nNow, you also have to consider the mass of the car. We found that when the car had more mass, it also had more potential energy and therefore was able to go faster when this potential energy was transformed into kinetic. This was proven when we had a car mass of 44 kg, it had 2246 J of kinetic energy by the bottom of the hill. But when we upped the mass of the car to 50 kg, it had 2446 J of kinetic energy by the bottom of the hill. Therefore the greater the mass of the car, the greater the amount of energy it has.\n\nTo add to that, you need to take into account the drop height once again. We found that in order to create the most amount of speed, you need a higher drop height. We found this out when the initial drop height was 4-meters the top speed was only 8.84 m/s. But when we raised the initial drop height to 5-meters, the max speed also increased to 9.89 m/s.\n\nIn conclusion at the beginning of the ride, you need the most amount of potential energy that you can get. After that, if you are going to include hills or loops, which you should, you need to make sure that none of them are higher than the initial drop itself. If this were to happen you would never have enough potential energy to turn into kinetic energy to get up the hill, due to the law of conservation of energy. And remember, The higher the initial drop you can get, the more exciting the ride will be. And just a reminder, the mass of the carr will not matter with the top speed.\n\nSincerely,\nRoller Coaster Engineer", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "54", "Raw": "64", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 124", "Quality": " 0.5161", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7339", "Comprehensive": "0.6250", "Content Unit": "0(5), 3(5), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 7(4), 9(4), 11(3), 14(3), 15(3), 18(3), 23(2), 27(2), 29(2), 32(2), 35(2), 37(1), 38(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 5 Segment ID: 2": "Content Unit: 11 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... when we raised the height to a meter drop, it had J of potential\n\t         .................... energy.\n\t", "sentence 6 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 5 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: ....................

There are two main types of energy which are potential and kinetic energy. When you add the potential and kinetic energy up, you get the total energy, which is used throughout the roller coaster and is the only energy that the roller coaster gets throughout the ride. The kinetic energy is energy that is moving the object. Potential energy is the energy that is being stored within an inanimate object. The car has kinetic energy moving down the hill. At the top of the initial drop, the kinetic energy is 0, and the potential energy is more than 0. When my initial height was 5m, the potential energy was 2446J, and the kinetic energy was 0J. At the bottom of the hill, the potential energy was 0J and the kinetic energy was 2446J. The potential energy that is at the top of the initial drop is the highest amount of potential energy throughout the entire roller coaster. There is never energy that is stored at the bottom because all the energy is being used as kinetic energy. But there is also no kinetic energy at the top of the roller coaster because the car is not moving.  When a car goes down a hill, the potential energy decreases while the kinetic energy increases. This concludes that the total energy at the initial drop is the only energy that the roller coaster will use throughout the roller coaster, which follows the law of conservation of energy that states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. \n\nAdding a hill that makes the ride more exciting is an easy concept, and here's why. The height of the hill only has to follow one rule, the height of the hill has to be less than the height of the initial drop. When making my roller coaster, the hill height was 2.5m, and the initial drop was 5m. The car got over the hill and through the roller coaster. This happened because the energy that was stored at the top of the initial drop was enough energy to last throughout the hill. If the hill height is higher than the initial drop, then the car will not have enough energy to make it throughout the hill and coaster. \n\nThe mass of the car is important because it decides how heavy the car is. If a car has little mass, it won't have enough energy to go through the whole roller coaster. It won't have enough potential energy at the top, which won't give it enough kinetic energy to go through the rest of the coaster. When the mass of the cart was 60kg, the potential energy was 2448J, but when the mass of the cart was 40kg, the potential energy was 1958J. A car with greater mass will have greater energy in motion or at rest. \n\nThe height of the initial drop affects the speed of the car greatly. The higher the initial drop, the faster the car goes. When the initial drop was 5m, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.88m/s, and the speed at the top of the hill was 7.01m/s. But when the initial drop was 3.5m, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.27m/s, and the speed at the top of the hill was 4.40m/s. The higher the initial drop, the more potential energy the car has, this gives the car more energy to convert to kinetic energy, which helps the car go faster. \n\nThe mass of the car has a lot to do with the car's energy, but it has nothing to do with the speed of the car. When the Mass of the Car was 60kg, the speed at the bottom of the initial drop was 9.88m/s, and the speed at the top of the hill was 6.98m/s. But when the Mass of the Car was 40kg, the speed at the bottom of the initial drop was 9.88m/s, and the speed at the top of the hill was 6.98m/s. As you can see, no matter what the mass of the car is, the speed at the bottom of the initial drop and the speed at the top of the hill will always be the same.  \n\nI would recommend having a super high initial drop, around 5m. Your hill should be high in order to be fun, but not higher than the initial drop, so about 4.5m. A loop would be super fun and make it exciting, but just like the hill, lower than the initial drop, so about 4.5m. If your loop is higher or equal to your initial drop, you won't have enough potential energy to make it through. The mass of your car should be 60kg so you can have lots of potential energy to make it through the roller coaster. The Law of Conservation of Energy affects the ride because the potential energy at the top of the initial drop is the total energy that you have throughout the rest of the roller coaster.

The changes in Potential energy and Kinetic energy can shift back and forth and they will equal the total energy when added together if there is more energy then it will make the ride better because there is more total energy. The law of conservation of energy says that energy cannot be destroyed but it can transfer or shift back and forth because the energy cannot be destroyed. The relationship between initial drop height and hill height is that the initial drop is the initial drop has to be bigger than the hill height or else the roller coaster will be unsuccessful. The relationship between mass, potential energy, and kinetic energy is the more mass you have the more potential energy and kinetic energy you will have. For example, the car mass is 60 kg the potential energy is 2938 J and the kinetic energy will be higher once the roller coaster is moving. My team's current roller coaster will be fun because we know what will and what will not work. The relationship between potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy is that potential and kinetic will always equal the same total energy no matter what they can shift back and forth and the total energy will stay the same. \n\nWhen you have your initial drop height at 5 m the speed you will get will be much higher than what it would be with any other initial drop height. For example, when the initial drop height is 5 m the speed at bottom of the drop will be 9.17mls, the speed at the top will be 7.05 m/s and the speed at the end of the ride will be 9.88 m/s. Compared to the initial drop height of 4.50 m the speed at the bottom of the drop will be 6.92 m/s the speed at the top will be 6.27 and the speed at the end of the ride will be 7.65 m/s. \n\nI found that the mass and speed don't really affect each other because the only thing that changes is the bottom of the drop but the speed at the top of the hill will always be 6.97 m/s and the speed at the end will be 9.88 m/s.

The science behind the roller coaster is that there will always have to be a inital drop and of course a hill or multiple. The roller coaster drop has to be higher then the hill always because if its not the roller coaster won't make it up the hill. In my data, the height of the inital drop was 5 jules, that means that the hill would have had to be 4.5 or less. In my case, I set my hill height to 4. The roller coaster kept going till it reached the end because the hill was shorter then the inital drop. As you go down the hill the potental energy and the kenetic energy can shift. At the very top of the drop, the potental energy is the highest. When you get to the bottom of a hill, the kenetic energy will be higher then the potental energy because the shift. The total energy will always be the same of what the potental energy was at the very top of the drop. Car mass plays a big role in the roller coaster process. As the car mass gets larger, so does the potental energy, and as it get smaller the potental energy does as well. The law of conservation of energy says that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. The potental energy at the top is realated to the kenetic energy at the bottom because it will shift. When the cart is at the top of the coaster the potental energy will be high and when the cart is at the bottom of the coaster, the kinetic energy will be low. As the cart goes up and down the potental energy will shift to kenetic energy as the cart goes down the hill. The coaster will have a very tall drop height because when my drop height was taller the cart would go faster. In my data when the drop height was 5m, the speed at the top was 9.88m/s, the speed at the bottom was 6.97 and the end speed was 9.88. When I changed the drop height to 2.80m the speed at the bottom was only 7.40m/s, at the top is was only 2.42m/s and at the end it was 7.39m/s. The mass didn't really matter for the speed. In my data when I changed the mass of the car to 60kg and 50kg, all the numbers in my data stayed the same. The speed at the bottom stayed at 9.89m/s, the speed at the top of the hill stayed at 6.99m/s and the speed at the very end stayed at 9.88m/s.

To do that my team and I have decided to use gravity as the main source of energy. We will use other forces to get to the initial drop. Once at the top, there will be lots of potential energy and no kinetic energy as shown in my data. At a release height of 5 meters, the potential energy at the top was 2443J and the kinetic energy at the top was 0J. We will also have a hill after the initial drop, but it will have to be shorter in height than the initial drop otherwise the car will not be able to get over the hill. For example, the top of my initial drop was 5 meters high and the potential energy was 2449J and 0J of kinetic energy, but at the top of the hill the potential energy was 2321 and the kinetic energy was 127. This shows that the hill will need to be shorter than the initial drop because it won't have as much energy as it did going down the initial drop. \n\nAnother factor we should use is the weight of the car. My data shows that the heavier the car the more potential and kinetic energy and total energy. The total energy will always equal the potential and kinetic energy added together. No matter how much energy there is the potential and kinetic energy can only shift between each other. This will affect our ride by making the ride safe by not using too much energy. When moving down a hill on a roller coaster the potential and kinetic energy shift greatly, at the top the potential energy is at its most but then at the bottom the kinetic energy is at its most while going fast.\n\n I have discovered that the drop height has affected the speed of the car drastically. At 5m the speed of the car at the bottom of the initial drop was 9.89m/s, but at 4m the speed was only 9.37m/s. This shows that the height of the drop affects the speed. I tested if the mass of the car mattered. All of my tests were done at a height of 5m for the initial drop. At a mass of 60kg the speed of the car at the bottom of the initial drop was 9.89m/s, but with a car weighing only 45kg was still 9.89m/s. This shows that the mass of the car does not matter only the height of the initial drop affects the speed with no friction. \n\n\n\nSo in other words if we build our roller coaster off the tests my team has done, and the data we have collected. You will have yourself the biggest, fastest, and best roller coaster on the market. And will for sure bring attention to the Gonzalez Family Amusement Park.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "35", "Raw": "53", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 104", "Quality": " 0.5096", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6078", "Comprehensive": "0.5587", "Content Unit": "1(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 9(4), 11(3), 17(3), 20(2), 27(2), 28(2), 34(2), 37(1), 41(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 28 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "6278bd4757433ebc821c6c25", "class_id": "2", "teacher_id": "JB", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "When making a roller coaster, the first thing that is important is that the initial drop needs to be the highest point during the whole ride, this is because that is where the total energy will be, the law of conservation of energy says that energy can be transported but not created or destroyed, so the initial drop energy is all the energy you get. During the simulation my data shows that when the initial drop was 5 m the coaster got to the end when the hill was 2-4 m since that is shorter than the initial drop. \n\nThe potential energy and the kinetic energy will always equal to the total energy, therefore when the potential energy is at the top, for example 2444 (J) and the total energy is 2444 (J) that means that the kinetic energy is 0 at the initial drop. However, when the car moves down the hill, the energy is going to get transported, since kinetic energy is the motion of the cart it is going to increase as it goes down the hill, my data shows that the kinetic energy was 0 at the initial drop but was 2441 (J) at the bottom of the initial drop. since the kinetic energy is going up, the potential energy is going to go down, since they together need to equal the total energy, so the potential energy was 3 (J) at the bottom of the hill, 2441+3= the total energy which was 2444 (J). \n\nMy data states that with a car mass of 60 kg the potential energy was 2937 at the top of the initial drop, and 2932 (J) of kinetic energy. The mass of the cart is also an important factor when creating your coaster, the more mass, the more total energy you will have, so the more potential energy at the top and the more kinetic energy at the bottom. But when the mass was 40, the initial drop was 1958 (J) and the bottom of the drop was 1940 (J), therefore the bigger the mass the more energy. \n\nThe drop height and speed will also make a difference when creating your roller coaster, to sum it up, the bigger the drop height the more speed. This is because the more drop height the more potential energy so the more PE the more energy the car has to go faster, (more speed.) My data supports this because it shows that when the initial drop height was 5 m, the speed at the bottom and end was 9.88 m/s, but when the initial drop height was 3.5 m the speed at the bottom and end was 8.27 m/s so that proves that the higher the drop height, the more speed. \n\nWhen thinking about a roller coaster, you would think that the mass of the cart would affect how fast the cart goes, but the mass is not going to affect the speed. Mass does not affect speed because potential energy pushes the cart so the mass doesn't have anything to do with the speed of the car. My data shows that when the mass was 40 kg, 55 kg, 60 kg, and 50 kg the speed at the bottom and the end was 9.88 m/s. Proving, mass does not affect speed. \n\nThis is the best roller coaster design. The initial drop would be 5 m, allowing the most speed and the most energy, we want to most speed to make it fun, and the most energy because that is the only amount of energy you get throughout the whole coaster and we need a lot to get over the loop and hill (The energy will be transported but not created or destroyed) . The loop would be 4.5 m because it needs to be smaller than the initial drop, but it needs to be high enough where we can make another hill. Then the hill would be 3 m high since it needs to be smaller than the initial drop and the loop. The mass of the car will be 60 kg because the more mass, the more total energy, the more potential energy at the top, and the more kinetic energy at the bottom. The mass does not affect the speed so that isn't a factor you need to discus when making your coaster.

I hear you are building a brand new roller coaster and want some advice on how to make it. \n\nThe first piece of advice I have for you is to make sure your initial drop is taller than all of your hills. This is because if you make a hill too tall, there won't be enough total energy to get your cars over the hill. This is because the higher a drop or hill is, the more potential energy it holds. When the car is rolling down the drop that energy gets converted into kinetic energy. Keep in mind, you can't add more energy when the car goes over the taller hill. The total energy always stays the same. Kinetic energy and potential energy always equal that total energy. Through the WHOLE ride. This concept is called the law of conservation of energy. To make your hills taller, you have to make your drop higher. \n\nMy second bit of advice for your new roller coaster is to make the cars heavier. The more mass an object holds the more potential energy it has when it is still, and the more kinetic energy it has when it is in motion. \n\nThe main thing to keep in mind is if the car doesn't have enough kinetic energy to go over hills, you need to make the initial drop higher. \n\nThe car starts out in a resting position at the top of the initial drop. This is where all of the energy is potential. As soon as you put the car in motion, and it starts descending, it is now converting more and more potential energy into kinetic energy. When it gets to the bottom, almost all the energy is kinetic. \n\nThe higher the initial drop, the faster your car will go. This is because it has more potential energy when the drop is higher, and more time to speed up going down the drop. The taller the initial drop is the more time the car will have to gain speed and the more gravity will pull it down the drop. For example, in my data from the height and speed experiment, when the initial drop height was 5 m the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.88 m/s. But when initial drop was 2 meters the speed at the bottom of the drop was 6.25 m/s. The speed of the car when using the 2 meter drop also didn't make it to the top of the hill. \n\nFor my mass and speed experiment I picked 5 meters as my drop height the whole time, which had a speed of 9.88 m/s at the bottom of the drop, and 7.05 m/s at the top of the hill. While in that experiment, that speed didn't change no matter what the mass of the car was. For the 60 kg car it was 9.88 m/s, and the 40 kg car also had 9.88 m/s at the bottom of the drop. So, the mass does not effect the speed of the car. \n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "44", "Raw": "63", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 114", "Quality": " 0.5526", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7225", "Comprehensive": "0.6376", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 7(4), 14(3), 15(3), 16(3), 17(3), 19(3), 20(2), 27(2), 28(2), 32(2), 37(1), 42(1), 46(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1)", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 32 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... there wont be enough total energy to get your cars over the hill.\n\t", "sentence 5 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 6 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: ....................

The roller coaster doesn't stop until the end because of potential and kinetic energy.\n\nThe hills and loops that are in the roller coaster will be less than the initial drop height. When the hill is less than the drop height then it will make it over the hill but if it's the same or more than the drop height, it won't make it over. An example of this is, when the initial drop height was 5m and the hill height was 5m the roller coaster car didn't make it over the hill but when the initial drop was 5m and the hill height was 4.73m the roller coaster car made it over the hill. Which is why our roller coaster doesn't have any hills or loops that are over the initial drop and we know that our roller coaster will make it to the end without stopping.\n\nCar mass has a big part in the total amount of energy and how fast the roller coaster goes. When the roller coaster car weighs more it has more total energy and the more potential energy. Such as when the car mass was 60kg it's total energy was 2932, whereas when the car mass was 40kg the total energy was 1955. The less mass the roller coaster car the faster it goes. That's why we are making the roller coaster cars weigh as little as possible so that the roller coaster can be faster and more exciting. \n\nThe smaller the roller coaster mass the faster the roller coaster. That's because the potential energy changes to kinetic energy faster. Potential and kinetic energy can be shifted from one to the other. That's because potential energy+kinetic energy=total energy. Which is why when the cart goes down the hill the potential energy goes up but once the cart starts going up the hill the potential energy shifts into kinetic energy which makes the kinetic energy go up. \n\nI am going to have a very high drop height because the greater the drop height the greater the speed. This is shown in my data because when the drop height was 2.80m the speed at the end of the ride was 7.39m/s but when the drop height was 5m the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88m/s. Which means that the taller the initial drop height the more speed it will get by the end of the ride.\n\nAlthough the drop height has a lot to do with speed the mass of the roller coaster cart has nothing to do with speed. I know this because when the car was 40kg the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88m/s and when the car was 60kg the speed at the end of the ride was still 9.88m/s. So the mass of the roller coaster car doesn't matter for the amount of speed that you get. \n\nKnowing all of these things will help me create the best roller coaster for the Gonzales family that is safe, entertaining and doesn't stop until the end of the ride.

The first is the only one with a hill that made is to the end of the ride. The second is that it had the most PE out of the four add a hill triels the PE was 2444 jules of PE and the others were much lower. Another reason is that it was a good example of the tranceference of energy. This is because the amount of energy at the initial drop was 2444, and the amount of KE was 0 but once it got to the hill the PE was 1458 jules of PE and the amount of KE on the hill was 986 jules of KE. The data shows that the initial drop must be higher than the hill or it won't make it to the end of the ride. The mass also plays a big part in it in my \"Mass and Energy\" triels I knowtist that the more mass that the car had the slower and less likely the car would make it to the end and the less mass the faster it went, and the more likely the car would make it to the end of the ride depending if the initial drop is taller then the hill.\nHight plays a big part in PE and KE because, the taller the initial hight the more PE there will be, and the more PE the more KE there will be at the top of the hill.

The initial drop on the top is where the Potential energy is the highest and where the Kinetic energy is the lowest on the data set that we have recorded. The kinetic energy is the highest on the lowest point of the computer where it used the amount of energy the Potential energy had. \n\nAs the car is moving down the hill the amount of energy shifts to Potential energy to Kinetic energy. If the hill height is 4m the roller coaster would have a higher energy point than if the hill was at 2m. When the energy transfers to one part to the other, this is called the law of conservation and that when the Potential energy moves on down the hill it transfers to Kinetic energy then when it goes up on another hill it will transfer all of the Kinetic energy to Potential energy. But if the hill was as tall as the initial drop the car would go back and forth which cannot actually happen because by doing this it is breaking one of newtons law.  But back to the question if the hill was 4m the Potential energy would be 2448 and a 2m hill the Potential energy would be 1224 making the car go slower than the 4m drop. If the initial drop was at 5m and the hill was at 3m the less there would be of Potential energy because the hill is smaller making less Potential energy for it to turn into Kinetic energy.\n\nNot only is the Initial drop and hill height count for the amount of Potential energy and Kinetic energy but so is the mass that can count towards the Potential energy and Kinetic energy. If the car's weight was at it's highest potential it would have the most potential energy on top of the hill (in which being 60kg) and the kinetic energy would have extreme amounts of velocity on downwards the hill because of its weight and as long as the hill is smaller than the initial drop.\n\nThis is why this roller coaster would be the best in the world ladies and gentleman.  \n\nEssay 2 \n\nMy teams roller coaster would make it to the end because it would have enough speed from the initial drop that it propels itself to the top but also the speed at the bottom would be around 6.7 m\\s right where the fun zone should be but also doing this will increase the guess rate at your park specifically. The best drop height is around 2-2.5 because it would be around the fun zone. As you increase the drop height the speed of the car will change making it go slower or faster depending on how fast you want it to be. The worst drop heights that were recorded was at 5-4 M because it would exceed the fun zone and enter the danger zone. The mass does not matter about the speed because looking at these recordings the mass did not change anything at all and looking at these speeds they all were 8.27 m\\s but however the height of the drop did contribute to the speed of the car more than any thing because all of the energy is used up then when it hits the bottom that is when it is the most fastest out of all of the other speed test we tested up the hill with a drop of 4 M and the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.84 m\\s which is past the fun zone by a lot and at the top the speed was at 2.16 m\\s which is significantly slower than the speed at the bottom of the drop which may give riders a moment to catch air before dropping yet again. The height can change the PE of the car because if the drop is higher the more the speed and the more PE builds up getting ready to release and the higher it is the less KE is going to be on the top while the PE is lower on the bottom and the KE is lower on top. The mass affects the PE and KE because the more mass you have the more likely it will change the PE on the top by adding more  and have more KE on the bottom because it has more mass and that is the independent variable here. But the law of conservation relates to energy and the initial drop and the mass of the car because they all have energy inside of them and when the PE is going down hill or going down the drop it all transfers to KE and since the car mass is higher the more you can see the law of conservation more present then ever because it all transfers to each other back and forth. \n\nThis is why my teams roller coaster is the best because it meets all of those requirements.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "54", "Raw": "55", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 124", "Quality": " 0.4435", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6307", "Comprehensive": "0.5371", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 11(3), 17(3), 18(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 32(2), 42(1), 43(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

From our data, we have found that when the Mass is at 55 it can still go over the hills. The KE on this, when dropped from the 5 mark, is 2701 (j). Also, the PE is 2707 (j) making this ride a fast ride also when judged from other rides it still outperforms most of them. We found that there were a lot of changes between the KE and the PE depending on how high the drop height was, If the height was higher the PE would be more so would the KE and if it was lower the opposite would happen. We also found that the conservation of energy is that if energy is conserved, the total will stay the same. One more factor to the hill hight and drop height is we could only make the hill height so height or it would not make it over if the starting height were 5 we could not make the hill height 5. One more thing we found is that the higher the roller coaster is the more energy it can create and has in PE. My team thinks that the initial drop should be higher than the hill height. Our idea was to make the starting point height at 5 and the hill height at 3 so that it has the PE of 2701(j) and it still makes it over the hill with speed. we learned as you increase the height of the roller coaster car the speed will also increase, One example of this is if you have the height at 5 and the mass of the car is 55. then the speed will be greater than if the same mass car was dropped from 3 and so on, if you increase the mass at a set height like 5 the speed will also very like if you changed it from 55 and made it 50 then the speed will go down, or if you increase the mass the speed will go up because of kinetic energy.

The Mass is 0 right now because it's on the bottom of the hill. But once you get to the top of the hill the mass (Potential Energy) will go up with the height of it. So let's say if you went about 1000 ft high for the drop of the mass (potential energy) the energy will go up. You will have to wait for about 2 minutes before you start the ride to just let everyone get on. You will slowly move up to the top of the hill. The mass will go up and the potential energy will too (Which are the same thing). The height of the initial drop is about 500 ft tall. The height affects the PE in that it goes up because the amount of gravity on the planet your standing is that your potential energy is 0. Since there is no energy. So once you go up it gets greater in number because now their energy. The height affects the KE because the speed of the car is going slow up the hill. But the speed of the car when you go down the hill will go faster because the friction will get you there. The height of all the parts is the hill is about 500 ft tall, the hill down is close to the ending stop 100 ft of the ground, then you go back up which makes it taller which it will be 400 ft loop all around, then when you come to the ground it comes to back around 50 ft of the ground. The mass of the car is 50 kg. The reason why I decided on each height and mass based on my data before all the trials was that every time I tried to make the hill or the loop bigger than my drop height the car would always come back down. Let's say if the drop hill was about 900 ft and the loop or hill was at 1000ft the car would not go over because there is not that much kinetic energy left. Then once the loop is all over the potential energy with go down and the kinetic energy will go up. The mass of the car will not change at all because it does matter the mass but it does not change. The science behind all these rollercoasters is the higher the loop is the slower you go but the lower the loop the fastest you go. So that is why I thought that I would make the loop lower the my drop height because we want it to be safe. So around the loop, it went 8.4 m/s because it is safe to go that speed if you go any faster it's not that safe for younger people and even older. For the ride down from the drop height it was 8 miles per hour because that is also safe. But when we were heading up there to get to the drop height, it was about 5 m/s. Since we want it fun but also not boring. The law of conservation of energy affects my design decisions because I put it at the right amount of energy to make it double fun which the speeds are 8.4 and 6.7. For the drop height and speed data the higher the drop height is the faster it goes in one piece of data there are the drop height of 5 and the speed at the end of the ride is 9.88 and at the end, I put 2 at the drop height and the ending speed was 6.97 which is way slower.

For example, I did the hill height at 5 m because the hill was the same as the initial drop and because they are the same height the car of the roller coaster didn't make it to the end of the roller coaster. Another example, is when the hill height is at 5 m the PE at the top of the initial drop is at 2449 but at the top of the hill it's at 0 because the hill and the initial drop are at the same height. If the hill height is smaller than the initial drop the car will make it to the end but if it's the same height the car would barely make it to the top of the hill. In the data of Mass and Energy Data, it shows that if the car mass is above 50 the PE at the top of the initial drop is more than the KE at the bottom of the drop. the height affects PE and KE because the more height the initial drop has the more PE it has and less KE it has, but then as the car starts going down the initial drop the KE and the PE switch and the more KE it has and the less PE it has at the bottom of the initial drop. the mass affects the PE and the KE because the more mass the car has the more PE and KE it has but if the car mass is less then 50 the less PE and KE it has.

The higher the track the more potential energy there is, and the more potential energy there is the more kinetic energy is created. The transfer between potential energy and kinetic energy is the process of conserving energy. When adding hills to the track the hills should not be more or equal to the height of the initial drop. Another thing to suggest for your roller coaster is to make the car have a larger mass because in Mass & Energy we learned that the higher the mass the more potential energy and kinetic energy is created. In trial number one the total amount of energy reached 1,956 with a car mass of 40 kg and an initial drop height of 5 meters. Also, the hill height was 2 meters. But on trial number 4 the car mass was 60 kg and had 2,934 for the total amount of energy at the bottom. Both trial number one and trial number 4 had the same initial drop height of 5 meters, hill height of 2 meters. Based on the data we have collected the hill height should be 5 meters, the hill height should be less than 5 meters and the car mass should be at 60 kg. That way there is more potential energy created so the amount of kinetic energy will also be a high amount. The potential energy and kinetic energy make the car reach the end of the track. The mass affects the weight of the car and the amount of potential energy is created. Height changes the amount of potential energy that is created. The higher the hill the more potential energy there is and the more kinetic energy is created. The roller coaster that we are building will be exciting with a very tall initial drop and some other smaller hills that will be added. For our newer roller coaster ride we will have an initial drop at 3.5 meters, a hill height at 3 meters, and a roller coaster car at 60 kilograms. Our roller coaster will be exciting, fast, will be safe , and will make it to the end of the ride. For our height we chose 3.5 meters because it will create a safe speed, and because the higher the initial drop the more potential energy there is, and the more potential energy, the more kinetic energy there will be. For our hill height we chose 3 meters because if the hill height is equal to or more than the initial drop the roller coaster car will not make it to the end. For the mass we chose 60 kilograms because the speed will not be affected by the mass, and there will be more potential and kinetic energy created. The conservation of energy is the transfer between potential to kinetic energy. Total energy is the total amount of energy that is created and transferred between potential and kinetic energy. The more potential energy the more kinetic energy is created, which helps the roller coaster get to the end of the track. The higher the hill the more potential energy there is.

The speed needs to be 8.4m/s at the fastest for safety reasons, and a minimum of 6.7m/s to make the ride more enjoyable to riders. The car will have enough energy and speed to make it up the hill and to the end of the ride. The mass of the car does not matter because the speed will be the same no matter what throughout the entire ride. My teams current roller coaster design will be exciting and make it to the end of the ride without stopping because we have made sure that the hill is going to be/is shorter than the initial drop height. If the hill was taller than, or the same height as the initial drop, the car would not be able to make it to the top of the ride. For example, when the hill height was the same height as the initial drop (5m), the total energy was 0J because the car was not able to make it down the hill. When the hill height was 4m, the PE at the top was 1,966J and the KE was 479J. The lower the hill height, the more KE at the top. At the top of the ride is PE which is stored energy. There is less KE at the top of the hills and initial drop height if any, KE is energy in motion so there is more KE when the car has already made it down the initial drop and to the top of the hill. Total energy is the total amount of energy used throughout the ride. At the top of the initial drop there is no KE, only PE and as soon as the car starts to go down the drop, the energies completely transfer. The Law of Conservation of Energy affects my design decisions and also means that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transfered. Mass also plays a key factor in building roller coasters because depending on the mass of the car, the amount of energy will be different. For example, when the car mass was 40kg, the total energy was 1,956J. But when the car mass was 60kg, the total energy was 2,934J. The bigger the mass of the car, the more total energy there will be. The heights of the different parts of my roller coaster have to be able to make the car gain enough speed to make it up the next hill, loop, ect.

The height of the drop relates to the PE at the top because when you make the initial drop higher, the less kinetic energy there is so therefore it transforms into more potential energy. The KE at the bottom relates to the drop because at the bottom you can't go any faster so when you reach the bottom all of the potential energy that was used in the drop, was converted to kinetic. The changes in the PE and KE while going down this initial drop is that when going down the drop, the PE started to decrease, while the KE started to increase. I made the initial drop height 5 meters so that it is at the maximum height and then you can also have really tall hills. The initial drop height has to be taller then the hills which is why I made it 5 m.\n\nFor the mass of the car, I chose to make it 50 kg so that it's right in the middle and doesn't go too fast or too slow. The relationship between mass, PE, and KE is that when the mass is greater the KE and PE are greater as well. the relationship between mass and KE is a direct relationship and the relationship between mass and PE is also direct.\n\nFor the hill height, I did 4.5 m tall because since in my experiments I found out that having an initial drop height of 5 m and a hill height of 5 m, it didn't make it over the hill so having 4.5 I know can make the ride fun and exciting while being practical and making it to make sure it makes it through. The relationship between PE and KE is probably inverse because when the PE decreases, the KE increases and vis versa.

The reason this works is that height is in direct relationship with potential and kinetic energy. The reason why you want more potential and kinetic energy is that again potential energy also known as PE makes it more exciting. \nOn the other hand, kinetic energy also known as KE makes it go faster total energy is the amount of energy used, the reason the PE does not stay with the car when it gains KE is that according to the law of conservation of energy: energy can not be created or destroyed only transferred.\nWhen the coaster car is at the top of the hill it has more PE but when it goes down it ends up gaining more KE than PE. When the ride is done all the potential and kinetic energy are transferred back to the total energy.\n My second suggestion is that you make your hill height 4.5 meters. the reason it is not 5 meters which would be the same height as the initial drop for more speed is that it is not physically possible. The car would not have enough energy to get up the hill.\nAt the drop height, we can get the cars up but we will not be able to help after that. So because of this, the car would simply not have enough energy. 3 is the tallest height with the highest amount of energy I would suggest.\nThis brings me to my third and final suggestion. I think that the car should be 40 Kilograms. Mass might directly relate to PE and KE so making it heavier will again make it have more PE and KE, but it does not make it faster Height is the thing that makes it faster. 40 kg would be the cheapest weight.\nall of this is making it more exciting, fast, and enjoyable for the people who go on this ride.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "11", "Raw": "21", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 47", "Quality": " 0.4468", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.2408", "Comprehensive": "0.3438", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 11(3), 15(3), 35(2), 42(1), 51(1), 60(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 15 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... meters.\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 51 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3957cc3a9535eae0e7", "class_id": "2", "teacher_id": "PN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "Dear Gonzales family, \n\n           I have been doing some experiments on making you guys a new rollercoaster and I am writing to you to tell you all that I have learned.\n\nStarting with the initial drop height I have found that the higher the drop the more energy the ride has. When the drop height is higher it adds a number to the PE and the KE equations. The PE is the energy that something has that is waiting to be used and the equation for PE is PE=mgh so when the height of the drop is bigger, the total amount of PE will be greater. The height of the drop also applies to the total amount of KE. The KE is the energy that is being used when something is in motion and the equation for KE is KE=m(1/2)v2 so even though the height isn't included in the equation the height will affect the velocity which makes the total amount of KE higher. To find the total energy at the end of the drop you add up the PE and KE when the car is at the bottom. You do the same thing to find the total energy at the top of the drop by adding the PE and KE of the car. I also found that when the car is at the top of the ride it has more PE than KE, that's because the car is not moving so it is only PE. Although, when the car is going down the drop the number of PE decreases, and the number of KE increases. That is because according to the law of conservation of energy, energy can not be created or destroyed, the energy just transforms into a different type of energy. So there is the most PE when the car is at the top of the drop waiting to go down and there is the most KE when the car is at the bottom of the drop. When the car is in motion all the PE is no longer being stored, instead, it is being used as KE.\n\nNext, is the hill. When adding a hill it must be a shorter height than the drop. This is because no help is being added to the car to help it go over a hill that is bigger than the drop. When I did my test I found that when I had the drop at 5 meters and then added a hill that was 5 meters it could not get over the hill since that is the same height as the drop. When the car goes up the hill the amount of PE and KE changes. The amount of KE drops because the car slowly loses momentum so it slows down and the amount of PE goes up because the car is starting to come to a stop.\n\nLast, is the mass of the car. There is more energy with a heavier car because the mass plays a part in both the KE equation and the PE equation. When the car has more mass it affects the two equations because just like I said before, PE=mgh and KE=m(1/2)v2. When there is more mass added to the equations then the total amount of KE or PE will be higher and if we have more KE and PE then we have more total energy and if we have more mass and then the ride will be the most fun but still safe.\n\nI believe that after all of the tests I've done we should have the drop height be 3.25 meters high because that's the highest we can go to make it fun and keep it safe. The speed of the 3.25 drop was 7.97. Anytime I did a drop that was over 3.25 meters high the speed went over 8.4 and that is not safe. Also, we should keep the mass of the car at 50 (the original mass) because I have found that the mass of the car will not affect the speed of the ride. In my tests, I had the mass of the car change for every test and the speed was the same whether the mass was 40 kg or 50 kg.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3957cc3a9535eae0dc", "class_id": "2", "teacher_id": "PN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "Dear Gonzales family,\n\nI have done some research and have found some new things to add to make a great roller coaster. I think the best initial drop height would be 3.5 meters and the hill right after should be 2.75 meters. It is high enough to get good speed and have more PE and KE for the ride. Also when you're on a ride a \"fun\" roller coaster goes above 6.7 at some point but to have it be safe it can not go above 8.4. When it comes to PE, KE, and TE they cant be created or destroyed. No matter what the TE will stay the same because of the conservative of mass. No matter how much PE and KE you have the TE will stay the same. PE and KE have an inverse relationship because when one goes down the other goes up and vice versa. When you are at the top of the initial drop you have all PE but once you start going down the drop that PE changes into KE. \n\nThe hill height has to be less than the initial drop height because the initial drop height has the most energy of the ride and if you have a hill over that height it will not make it over because it does not have enough TE to get up the hill or in other words, all the hills on a roller coster need to be shorter then the initial drop height. the initial drop height determines the TE for the ride. (m*g*h) and you cant create or destroy energy, so no hill can have a higher height than the initial drop. So with that in mind, I think a good hill height would be 2.75 meters. \n\nWhen it comes to the mass it is a tough decision because the more mass you have the more TE you have, but it takes more energy to push the cart and get it going. Also when you have more mass some of the energy gets turned into less useful energy like heat. So considering of that I think it would be good to go with a mass of 47 kg would be good because if you go any higher than that you start to lose energy because it is being transferred into the tracks and ground and becoming heat. So it does not break the conservation of mass.  \n\nHeight and PE have a direct relationship which means when one goes up the other one goes up. So when you have a bigger drop height you will have more PE. It is the same with height and KE they have a direct relationship so when one goes up the other will go up too. As evidence to prove they are a direct relationship look at their formulas. M*G*H and 1/2*M*V2. Height is in both of them. One is harder to tell because it is not in there directly but velocity counts on height. The higher you are up the more velocity you will have. \n\nHeight and mass affect the speed because when you start higher you have more PE to use on the ride. But when it comes to how height and mass affect each other it is a different story. If you start at the same height but 1 car has 100 kg of mass and the 2nd car has 25kg of mass they go the same speed down the hill.\n\nThat is all I have for you right now. I think this information should be able to give you some good ideas for your rides. \n\n- Aly Fulton \n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "47", "Raw": "35", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 117", "Quality": " 0.2991", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4014", "Comprehensive": "0.3503", "Content Unit": "3(5), 9(4), 15(3), 18(3), 25(2), 27(2), 29(2), 32(2), 35(2), 39(1), 44(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 15 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... meters and the hill right after should be.\n\t", "sentence 5 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 52 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

For the new best roller coaster design the team has decided that the height of the drop should be 3.5 meters, in the trails we conducted for the roller coaster that provided the most total energy out of all the total heights. We also had to consider the greatest height the drop can be without it being unsafe. The speed needs to be under 8.4 m/s, the max speed a drop from 3.5 meters can have is 8.3 m/s so it is safe. A drop at 4.5 meters has more Jules than a drop at 3.4 meters, but that isn't safe for the riders on the ride so we have to settle with a drop of 3.5 meters. We get the most possible energy from the higher the hill is, the law of conservation of energy says energy cannot be created nor destroyed so we need to get as much energy as possible so we can have hills and loops on the ride, also while having the ride still be safe. The height directly affects the PE because height is the formula for PE, height also directly affects KE even though it's not in the formula because velocity is in KE's formula and you need the height to find the acceleration/velocity, so it directly affects KE. So a 3.5-meter drop will provide the most total energy so we can have hills and loops in the ride. The hill height we have chosen for the ride will be 3 meters, unfortunately, the hill height needs to be less than the drop height because energy cannot be created nor destroyed and the car needs to make it over the hill so the hill needs to be less than the drop. When you go up a hill the kinetic energy will decrease, when we go down the hill the kinetic energy will increase, so we need to have enough energy to make it over the hill. In our trails for the roller coaster, the more height the more PE and KE in total. The PE and KE are directly related to each other and the total energy. The PE will go down as the car goes down the drop and the KE will go up to its full potential that the bottom of the drop. Now unfortunately since this is not a perfect world there will be friction on the ride, so some of the energy will transform into heat, so we need to try to have the most PE as possible so there will be enough to make it through the whole ride. We have done some tests and determined the mass of the car should be 60 Kg to have the most potential and kinetic energy for the ride. There is more energy for the more mass the car has, but the mass doesn't affect the amount of speed we get so any mass for the car is safe. Height directly affects the speed of the rollercoaster, the more height the more speed you have. Since in this situation, there is no friction none of the energy transfers into heat like I said before, but in the actual ride there will be friction but I believe that we have enough energy to make it through the entire ride.

This height allows there to be more PE at the top of the initial drop than any other height that may be lower. But why does the PE go to 1 J then? This is because if you look at the equation for PE you will see how it's based on three things mass, height, and gravity. So as the car continues down the drop there will be less and less for the car to go so once the car gets to the bottom there will not be as strong of a gravitational pull because the car is at ground level. PE and speed have a direct relationship which allows the car to travel fast and make it fun but also keep the ride safe. So this means that the higher the initial drop the more speed there will be. According to data at 3.50 meters at the bottom of the initial drop, the car will be moving at 8.22 m/s.\n\nThe hill height for the roller coaster should be 2.5 meters off the ground. Having the hill at this height will allow the KE to re-generate all its energy back after the initial drop occurred. Also, all the hills on a roller coaster need to be shorter than the initial drop height. The initial drop height will determine the total energy for the ride (mxgxh) and you can't create energy or destroy it. So no hill can have a higher height/require more energy to climb. At the top of the hill, there will be enough PE re-generated that can allow the car to make it to the end of the ride (5.55 m/s).\n\nThe car mass should be 40kg. PE and KE both have a direct relationship with mass. But the mass of the car does not determine how much speed there will be. Unlike PE and KE which have a direct relationship. Mass and speed have no relationship. So whatever the mass of the car may be it will not affect the speed during the ride.  Also according to the data at 40kg, the car will be moving at 8.20 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop. At the top of the hill, it will be moving at 4.60 m/s and finally, at the end of the track, it will be moving 8.26 m/s. \n\nSince energy can't be created or destroyed the energy should be the same throughout. Wrong, unless the roller coaster has zero friction the rides PE and/or KE may decrease because it may turn into thermal energy which will heat the track. But since there is going to be friction the energy that the roller coaster has generated will be converted not destroyed. This can affect the ride because it could not let the car move as fast or be able to generate lots of PE and KE. The total energy that is created is when you add KE+PE or PE+KE.\n\nThis is what I think the roller coaster should look like.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "45", "Raw": "47", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 115", "Quality": " 0.4087", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5390", "Comprehensive": "0.4738", "Content Unit": "3(5), 6(4), 10(3), 11(3), 15(3), 17(3), 19(3), 22(2), 23(2), 27(2), 29(2), 32(2), 35(2), 37(1), 42(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 15 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... meters tall.\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

It also has more PE than if it were to be 2 meters. This also means that there would be more KE at the bottom of the drop. This is because height and PE have a direct relationship with each other, so the higher the drop, the more PE there will be. There is also a significantly larger amount of KE at the bottom because the height is also directly related to the KE at the bottom, so the higher the initial drop the higher the PE will be at the top, and the higher the KE will be at the bottom. This will make the roller coaster more fun, because you will be going faster. The relationship between PE, KE, & total energy is the that the total energy will be split between PE & KE however this split will not be equal, this is because energy can not be created or destroyed, so the energy just changes from one to another over a little bit of time. This is safe because it doesn't go faster than 8.4 m/s at any point but for most of the ride the speed is more than 6.7 m/s.\n\nAs for the Hill height I would keep it around 2.25 meters tall, because the speed at the top of the hill will be around 5.2 m/s, while still providing a slow down to make it seem as though you are going to go faster coming down the hill. Also at the top of the hill there will be a slight transfer of energy from KE to PE however neither one is going to have 100% of the total energy, because the car is still in motion, but also seeing as it is at the top of the hill there would be PE for the drop which then would transfer back to KE seeing as the cart is in motion.\n       \nI would also recommend that the car mass would be 60 kg because there is a significant difference even just from a car with 50 kg only has 2443 J of PE at the initial drop while the 60 kg car has 2930 J of PE at the initial drop. This is only a 10 kg difference, however there is nearly a 500 J difference between the two cars. The KE at the bottom for the 60 kg car is also a lot higher it is about 2930 J, while 50 kg car still only has 2443 J of KE at the bottom, which again is a 500 J difference in favor of the 60 kg car. However the mass of the car really only changes the amount of energy, and space it has, it doesn't affect speed. So depending on how many people you want to be able to fit in the car will change what mass the car should be to fit your preferences.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3957cc3a9535eae0e0", "class_id": "2", "teacher_id": "PN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "     For the final rollercoaster design, I have come up with the perfect new drop and initial drop height, and the mass of the car so that the rollercoaster will stay under 8.4 m/s but over 6.7 m/s. So today, I will be telling you what I think is the best decision for the rollercoaster to make it fun and exciting but also safe. \n     The first thing I will be talking to you about is the initial drop. I think that the best height for the initial drop is 3.5 meters which is lower than I originally thought. I think this because in order for the ride to be safe enough for people to ride it, it needs to be under 8.4 m/s. So when I made the height 5 meters, the speed got up to 9.8 m/s which is really unsafe. However, when I made the initial drop 3.5 meters, the speed got up to about 8.3 m/s which is just under the top amount causing the ride to still be fun. Also, this proves that height and speed are directly related because the higher I made the initial drop, the more speed the coaster had. Also, height and energy are directly related because the higher I made the initial drop the more potential and kinetic energy the car had throughout the ride. However, the amount of potential energy the coaster has at the top of the first drop is equal to the total amount of energy the coaster has the whole ride. This means that the initial drop has to be the highest drop on the ride, or the car won't be able to make it over any other hills. \n     When you are going down the first drop, potential energy is shifting into kinetic energy, meaning PE and KE are inversely related. This is because you are getting closer to the ground, which means that the amount of meters high you are goes down. And since height only takes place in the potential energy equation      \n(PE=h x g x m, KE=1/2m x v^2), that causes the amount of potential energy to go down. But why does the kinetic energy go up? This is because of energy transformation and the Law of Conservation of energy. This law says that energy can never be created or destroyed, it can only be transformed into other forms of energy. So as the potential energy goes down, it transfers into kinetic energy causing the kinetic energy to go up.\n     This same rule can be applied not just for the initial drop, but all over the rollercoaster, including the second hill in the rollercoaster. When you are going up the hill, kinetic energy is being transformed back into potential energy because the height is going up. \n     For the first hill of the rollercoaster, I think it should be 3 meters, and here's why. Since I changed the initial drop height to 3.5 meters instead of 5, I also had to change the first hill height too because if I would have kept it at 4.5 meters, the car wouldn't make it over the top. This is due to what we talked about earlier, and how the initial drop has to be the highest point in the rollercoaster. Also, when the hill is 3 meters the speed still goes over 6.7 m/s but stays under 8.4 m/s which ensures a safe ride.\n     Lastly, I am going to be talking about the mass of the car and why I think it should be 50 kg. In my experiment, I discovered that the higher you made the mass, the more kinetic and potential energy the object had throughout the ride. This means that mass and energy are directly related. When I made the mass of the car 40 kg, the total energy on the ride was only 1955 J. But when I made the mass 50 kg, the total energy was 2421 J. So 50 kg is the best mass for the car.\n     However, mass and speed don't have any relationship at all. This means that no matter the mass of the car, the rollercoaster will go the same speed. I know this because when I made the mass 40 kg, the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88 m/s, and when I made the mass 60 kg, the speed was also 9.88 m/s. So since the mass of the car doesn't really affect the speed and only the energy of the car, I think 50 is a good mass for the car.\n    Now that I've told you what I think the best design is, I hope you take it into consideration. My rollercoaster design will be both fun and exciting, as well as safe for all of the riders.

I am more than happy to help increase your park's popularity and income. After doing extensive research and collecting countless data, I have determined the best characteristics and traits for the new roller coaster to have. \n\nFor one to understand the data that I have collected, one must have an understanding of energy, how it works, and its different forms. Energy may seem like a complicated concept, but I can assure you that it is easy to understand as long as one knows a little about it. First, the law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. This is important to understand when creating a roller coaster because, at the initial drop height, it will have the same amount of energy as the end of the ride. So, the energy must be able to last through the ride and get over hills, through loops, and finish the ride in a safe, successful manner. Something to also keep in mind is that while energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can be transferred. When the roller coaster cart is going down a hill, forces such as friction, gravity, wind, and the tracks affect the cart, and some of its energy will be transferred into different forms (heat energy). Energy also has different forms. The two that stand out in this certain situation are potential energy (often abbreviated to PE) as well as kinetic energy (KE). Potential energy is the energy stored in something or energy that isn't being used. Common examples of PE are, an apple sitting on a desk, a stretched rubber band, and a roller coaster cart at the top of its initial drop. Kinetic energy is the energy that is being used within or on something (the energy of motion). Common examples of KE are, a person walking, a ball being thrown, and a roller coaster cart going down a hill or through a loop. PE, KE, and total energy are related directly. This means that if PE were to change, the KE would also change in the same manner, ultimately changing the total energy in the same way. If two of these energies were to react with each other, they would also have a direct relationship. For example, if the KE in a situation were to decrease, the total energy would also decrease. Another direct relationship when creating a roller coaster is between speed and height. The greater the height, the greater speed that will result from the height. However, if two variables such as speed and mass were to interact, there would be no relationship. This is because no matter the mass of something, it will fall at the same rate as something from the same height. If one were to drop a basketball and a crumpled piece of paper from the same height, they would hit the ground at the same time, supporting the fact that mass and speed don't have a relationship. Now that you know more about energy, its different forms, and how it applies to a roller coaster, I will use the data that I have collected to inform you on what characteristics are best for your roller coaster to make it safe and exciting. \n\nWhen designing your roller coaster, I have found that it is best for the initial drop to have a height of 3.5 meters (m). I know this because of how potential energy affects a roller coaster. Potential energy (PE) is the energy that the cart has at the top of the initial drop or the start of the ride. When the cart is at the top of the drop, although it may not be moving, it still has lots of energy that is stored within it. In fact, when it is awaiting its initial drop, the cart has the most PE. To calculate PE, the equation mass x gravity x-height is used (PE=mgh). By using this equation, we know that height and PE are directly related. So, if one were to increase the height, the potential energy would also increase. This is important to understand due to the fact that the total amount of energy at the top of the roller coaster must be able to last through the end of the ride because energy cannot be created or destroyed. So, the initial drop height should be fairly big in order to give the most amount of energy to the cart as possible. Something to also keep in mind, however, is keeping the ride safe and fun. In order for the ride to be fun, the speed must reach 6.7 m/s, but cannot exceed 8.4 m/s to ensure the safety of the riders. So, the initial drop should be a sweet spot between these two requirements, making 3.5 m a perfect height. The initial drop must also be the biggest drop throughout the ride in order for there to be enough energy for it to make it over the hills and loops, all of which should be smaller than the initial drop. I know this because, from the data that I have collected, when the initial drop height was 3.5 m, the cart had a total PE of  1,710 joules (J) whereas when the height of the initial drop was 2m, the total PE was 977J. This data clearly shows that if you want to have a safe and fun roller coaster, the initial drop height should be about 3.5 m, so that the PE will transfer into KE. This happens when the cart gains motion, the PE transfers into KE. This means that if the PE at the top of the roller coaster was 1710J, the KE at the bottom of the coaster would also be 1,710  (in a perfect, frictionless world). So, in order to make a roller coaster that has enough energy to make it to the end, the initial drop height should be 3.5 m. \n\nWhen adding a hill to your roller coaster, it should have a height of no greater than 3.5, but no less than 2(anything less would make the ride boring). A good height that I have found for this roller coaster is 2.25 m. This is because when testing different hill heights, I found that 2.25 m gave the cart 951J of PE and 762J of KE, which is a great balance to have, as it not only makes the ride exhilarating, but it also makes it so that the cart has enough energy to last throughout the ride. Also, when a cart travels downhill, the PE that it had at the top transfers into KE because it is in motion. And when the cart is going uphill, the KE transfers partly into PE due to the fact that the cart is slowing down when it reaches its peak. If the hill were to be greater than 2.25 m (3 or 4 m), then it could be risky attempting for the cart to get over the hill, because it might not always go overdue to things such as wind, friction, and cart mass. By understanding the law of conservation of energy, we know that energy cannot be created or destroyed. So, when the cart goes down the initial drop and then over a hill, it must have enough energy to do so, which means that the hill height cannot exceed the height of the initial drop, or else it won't have enough energy to make it over the hill. So, when creating your roller coaster, I suggest creating a hill height of 2.25 m.\n\nLastly, the cart's mass also plays a big role in how the roller coaster should be designed. After collecting data, I have found that the best mass for the cart to have is 60kg. This is because the greater the mass, the greater the energy. The equation for PE is PE=mgh. If the mass is greater the PE will also be greater because there is a direct relationship. The same thing applies to KE, as the equation is KE= 1/2m x v^2. However, when it comes to speed in the ride, the mass of the car doesn't matter. This is because speed and mass have no relationship, so when a car with a mass of 40kg goes down the ride, it will have the same exact speed as a cart with 60kg of mass. So, the greater the mass of the cart, the greater the energy, which will result in a much more fun and effective roller coaster, without affecting the speed, making 60kg a perfect mass for the cart. \n\nIn conclusion, I recommend having an initial drop height of 3.5m, a hill height of 2.25m, and a cart mass of 60kg in order to have the safest, most exciting roller coaster possible for your theme park. Thank you for allowing me to be of help to you, and I wish you the best in your family's amusement park. If you have any questions, please let me know.

Potential energy is stored energy that is not being used, and if an object has potential energy, it will be above ground. Kinetic energy is energy that is being used, and typically in motion. The car reacts this way due to the direct relationship between the height of the initial drop, and the energy the roller coaster has. The taller the drop, the more potential energy and kinetic energy the coaster will have. However, there is a maximum safe height so that the car doesn't go too fast. The maximum speed is 8.4. Evidence of this is shown in my data, when I started with a drop height of 2 meters, the potential energy at the top was 977 joules, and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 977 joules. When I did the same experiment, but with an initial drop height of 3 meters, the potential energy at the top was 1466 joules, and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1465 joules. This is showing an increase in potential and kinetic energy, the taller the drop height, so the taller the drop height, the more potential energy at the top, and the more kinetic energy at the bottom resulting in more total energy. This is a direct relationship between potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy.\n\nI also think that the roller coaster needs to have a hill that is shorter than the initial drop height because the law of conservation of mass says that energy can't be created or destroyed, and so once the car is dropped down the hill, there can't be more energy created to get it over another hill that is taller than the previous one. As the car goes down the initial drop, it is losing the potential energy that it had at the top, and all of the energy is being transferred to kinetic energy as it goes down the hill. Once it reaches the bottom, the car doesn't have any more to fall, and that is why there is no potential energy. Here is my data on why I think there should be a hill height of 2 meters. When I included a 2-meter hill after a 3.61-meter drop height, with a 50 kg car, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.4, which is the maximum speed for the ride to still be safe and fun. When I did the same experiment with a 2.2-meter drop height, a 2-meter hill, and a 50 kg car, the speed at the bottom was 6.56, which is below the 6.7 m/s minimum for the ride to be fun. So the higher the initial drop height, the taller the hill can be, and with a 2-meter hill with a 3.61 drop height, the ride will be the most fun.\n\nI believe that the car's mass should be 60kg because the more mass, the more energy the car had. This was shown in my trial when I had a car mass of 40 kg, at the top of the initial drop, the potential energy was 1955 joules, and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1954 joules. When I did the same experiment with a car mass of 60, there were 2932 joules of potential energy at the top of the initial drop and 2930 joules of kinetic energy at the bottom. This proves the point that the more mass the car has, the more KE and PE it will have and more total energy, that is a direct relationship. However, mass doesn't relate to speed. You can have any amount of mass, and if you have the same drop height and hill height, the speed will be the same. This is shown in my data when I tested a car with 60 kg, a drop height of 3.61, and a hill height of 2. At the bottom of the hill, the speed was 8.39, at the top it was, 5.61, and at the end, it was 8.40. When I did the same experiment with a 40 kg car, the speed at the bottom was 8.37, at the top it was 5.66, and at the end, it was 8.40. I wasn't able to stop the car in those positions perfectly for every trial, but based on my data, I can infer that if I did, the speed would be the same for each experiment. This shows that mass doesn't affect speed.\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "63", "Raw": "67", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.5038", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7683", "Comprehensive": "0.6361", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 28(2), 32(2), 35(2), 37(1), 40(1), 42(1), 45(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 5 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: .................... if an object has potential energy, it will be above ground.\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 4 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: ....................

This is because you will then have enough energy for the rest of the ride and it will also be safe enough. The rest of the ride would include a 3 - meter loop, 2.7 - meter hill into a corkscrew. Then it would go into a 2.3 - meter loop with a 2 - meter hill at the end. These things will make the roller coaster fun but also have a lot of energy so there is more thrill in the ride.\n\nThe Law of conservation of Energy states that the conservation of energy cannot be created or destroyed. This is when the potential energy transforms into kinetic energy. This shows that no new energy is being created and none of that energy is going away. Potential energy is energy stored in something. Potential energy comes from its location at rest so when the car is at the top of the dollar coaster almost ready to go down. This is shown when the car is at the top of the initial drop. They are building up energy so the car can go downhill and transform into kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is energy that is being used; it is the energy of motion. This is when the car is at the bottom of the hill. When the ride starts off with more potential energy, and some of that transforms into kinetic energy, it is showing that some of that energy is transforming into heat from the tracks. This is when there is friction included in the ride which is what all real dollar coasters have and also shows that no energy is being created or destroyed. But when there is no friction, the potential energy and kinetic energy stay the same and none of it transforms into heat.\n\nThe reason why all of this will work out is because of the science behind it. When going down the initial drop, you have a lot of potential energy. And when you get to the bottom, there is mostly kinetic energy. Also to have the best outcome you need the initial drop to be 5- meters tall. The data I collected can prove that. When the initial drop was 5 meters, it had 2,424 joules of energy whereas when the initial drop was 3- meters, it had only 1,398 joules of energy. The relationship between the hill height and the initial drop also has something to do with this. When the initial drop is 5 meters tall, the car cannot get over the hill at 5 meters. But when you lower the hill to 4 meters, the car can get over with just enough speed and also have the thrill you are looking for. When the hill height was 5 meters, the potential energy started at 2,449 and it only dropped down to 2424, but it couldn't make it over the hill. Then when you look at 4 meters, the potential energy was 2445 and dropped down a little \nlower to 1789. This is the perfect amount of energy to get a thrill and have more people at the amusement park. When you get down to a hill of only 2 meters, the potential energy drops down over 1500 joules. This would make the hills less interesting and fun so therefore you also need a 3-4 meter hill for the ride. Also when you are at the top of the drop, all of the energy is potential but as you go down the hill it turns into kinetic energy because the height decreases and the speed goes up. When you go up another hill, the potential energy starts increasing again and the kinetic energy decreases because there is less speed and more height. But to make it safe you have to drop the initial drop down to 3.6 meters.\n\nAnother factor in why it makes it to the end is how heavy the car is. When the car is heavier, it is harder for it to make it to the end. Even though it has a lot of potential and kinetic energy didn't make sure it made it to the end. Mass affects potential and kinetic energy. Mass and potential energy have a direct relationship meaning if the mass goes up, so does the potential energy. And it is the same with kinetic energy; when the mass of the car goes up, the kinetic energy also goes up. No matter what though, even with the more mass the car has, that doesn't mean that there will be more speed but it just means it has more energy. If there is a small mass like 40 kg, the speed is 8.25 at the bottom of the drop. When the mass is bigger like 52 kg, the speed at the bottom of the drop is still 8.25. This means that you should have a mass of 50 kg so that you will be able to fit more passengers but it will not affect the potential and kinetic energy as much. A car with greater mass will have greater energy no matter if they are at rest or in motion. Height also affects mass and speed. When the hill height is higher the speed when going down will also be more. And it doesn't matter what the mass is. This shows that height and speed have a direct relationship. When the height goes up the speed goes up, but when the height goes down, the speed would also go down.\n\n\nThis is why I think you should use my design for your new roller coaster.

And at the bottem of the first drop it fell for longer picking up velocity leading to more KE. Now since we have a lot of PE and KE we now have more total energy to get around the rest of the ride. Since we have a lot of total energy the car can now get around the 4 meter loop and since the total energy is up we have enough energy to get around the loop even though we lose some of the energy going around the loop.

So in essence the higher the roller coaster the more energy and better thrills. Also if you start with a lot of energy the more you get on the whole ride.\n\n Now the relationship between potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy is the amount of potential energy you have at the top of the hill is the same amount of kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill with zero friction. My test has shown that at the top of the hill there was 2428J of potential energy and at the bottom of the hill there was 2426J of kinetic energy which is nearly the same and the total energy was 2428J. So it has shown that you use the same amount of energy as you have at the top of the hill which is potential energy.\n\nNext, when the roller coaster rides down then up the hill you use the transformation of energy because at the top of the hill you start with potential energy but at the bottom of the hill you end with kinetic energy untell you fully stop and it is potential energy again. Also, you use conservation of energy when you are using kinetic energy for example and you don't fall down from gravity because it is stronger than gravity. So usually when you are going up a hill.\n\nThe relationship between the drop height and hill height is that the more the drop height the easier it is to get over the hill and the faster you will get over the hill. For example, when my drop height was 5 meters and my hill height was 5 meters the rollercoaster could not get over the hill.

Also that was the same for the kinetic energy so when you increase mass you increase kinetic and potential energy.\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "21", "Raw": "41", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 76", "Quality": " 0.5395", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4702", "Comprehensive": "0.5048", "Content Unit": "0(5), 3(5), 4(4), 9(4), 11(3), 15(3), 18(3), 20(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 46(1), 48(1), 51(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 11 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3957cc3a9535eae0ee", "class_id": "2", "teacher_id": "PN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "I am going to be telling you about the research that has been conducted about making a new roller coaster. First of all, the height of the initial drop is a huge factor in the amount of energy the cart is going to have when going threw the ride. If the height is tall for the initial drop is tall, the car would have a lot of potential energy that could be used when going down the drop. At the bottom of the drop, all of the potential energy(stored energy in an object.) would have been converted into kinetic energy(energy being used by an object) which is the energy that is making the car move. One other thing to consider is that only height in the simulations affected speed and the mass did not do anything to make the car go faster. This means that if I used a tall height, the car would go faster but in order to keep the ride safe and fun, the speed of the car can not exceed 8.4 m/s and not go below 6.7 m/s. the best drop height for this is probably a 3.35-meter height. Also, there is a direct relationship between PE and KE because if the PE goes up then so does the KE. This also means that there is a total amount of energy that is present throughout the whole ride and is constantly being converted from PE to KE depending on where the car is. When the Car is at the top of the initial drop, it only has PE and no KE but at the bottom, there is only KE and no PE since it got converted when going down the drop. The mass of the car will also affect the amount of energy because if there is a high mass, there would be a high amount of energy but a low mass will have not as much energy.\n             Note that not all of the PE is immediately turned into KE because the energy an object is storing so when the car is going down the initial drop, the first part of the drop has some of the PE get turned into KE since the car is moving and this keeps happening when the car is going down the drop until the car reaches the bottom of the drop and all of the energy has been turned into KE because the car is going as fast as the gravity affecting the car going down the initial drop would go and when the car goes uphill, it loses some KE and has it get turned into PE until the hill goes back down and all the energy returns to being KE. There is also the law of conservation of energy that states that energy cannot be created or destroyed so the only way to get energy is to have it transferred to the car and this is done by the car going to the top of the initial drop so it gets PE and then it can use that PE to be converted to KE so that the car can actually move down the drop. \n              When it comes to adding hills to the ride, you need to make sure that the hill is lower than the initial drop so it has enough energy to make over because friction can take some of the energy the car has and turn it into thermal energy. From the trials that I conducted, your best choice for a tall hill immediately after the initial drop is anything below 3.25 meters. Lastly, the mass of the car does not really matter because all that it does is give the car more PE at the top and therefore have the car get more KE at the bottom but since the drop height is the only thing that decides the speed of the car and the mass does not do much on the drop, any amount of mass is ok for the car,.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3957cc3a9535eae0ed", "class_id": "2", "teacher_id": "PN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": " Dear Gonzales family,\n\nI suggest that the initial drop height should be 5 meters. I think this because the higher the initial drop is, the more potential energy there is. When the initial drop was 3 meters, the potential energy was 1466 J. But when the initial drop increased to 5 meters, the potential energy at the top was 1955 J. This is why height and potential energy are directly related. If one goes up, so does the other and same for if one goes down so does the other. I know this because potential energy is found by multiplying mass times gravity times height. So the higher the height is, the more potential energy there is going to be. Height and kinetic energy are also directly related. When the height increases, so does the kinetic energy. So if you have a higher initial drop, you will have more kinetic energy. The further you fall, the more time you have to accelerate or increase velocity. \n\nThe relationship between potential energy and kinetic energy is that potential energy on the top of the initial drop will always be higher than the kinetic energy on the top of the initial drop. In trial one, the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was 1955 J and the kinetic energy was 0 J. Also, on trial 4, the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was 1466 J and the kinetic energy was 0 J. The relationship between potential energy and total energy is that with no friction, the total energy will be the same as the amount of potential energy as the car has at the top of the initial drop. When there is no friction, the total energy will be the same as the amount of kinetic energy the car has at the bottom of the initial drop. \n\nThe potential energy at the top of the initial drop is always going to be higher than the kinetic energy at the top. The potential energy at he top of the initial drop is 1955 J and the kinetic energy is 0 J.  And the kinetic energy will always be higher than the potential energy at the bottom of the initial drop. When the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1465 J, the potential energy was 0 J. When the cart is going down the initial drop, the potential energy transforms into kinetic energy. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed so the only way potential energy at the top of the initial drop can change into kinetic energy at the bottom, is from energy transformation. \n\nAny hills on the new roller coaster have to be shorter than the initial drop height. Since you can't create energy, the initial drop height determines the potential energy for the whole ride. (Mass times gravity times height.) If there is more car mass, there will be more kinetic and potential energy. \n \nThere is a direct relationship between the mass of the car and the potential energy the car has at the top of the initial drop. I know this because when the mass of the car goes up, so does the potential energy. (Mass times gravity times height.) So, we think you should make the mass of the car 60 kg. There is also a direct relationship between the mass of the car and the kinetic energy has at the bottom of the initial drop.This is true because when the mass of the car goes up, so goes the kinetic energy. (1/2 times mass times velocity squared.)\n\nHeight and speed are a direct relationship. This means the higher the initial drop is, the more speed there is going to be. When the initial drop was 2 meters, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 6.25 m/s. When the initial drop height was 5 meters, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.88 m/s. Mass and speed do not have a relationship whatsoever. This means the more mass the car has, the speed will always stay the same. When the mass of the car was 40 kg, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.83 m/s. But when the car mass was 60 kg, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.83 m/s as well.  Mass does not affect speed because if gravity and height are the same, the velocity will also be the same even if the car mass is not. \n\nLaw of Conservation of Energy states no energy can be created or destroyed. But, energy can transfer from one form to another. At the top of a friction less initial drop, the kinetic energy is 0 J. But, the final kinetic energy  equals what the the initial potential energy was because potential energy turned into kinetic energy. The relationship between potential energy and kinetic energy is that they can transform into each other. The relationship between total energy, kinetic energy and potential energy is that kinetic and potential energy equals total energy. When there is friction, some energy is transformed into heat causing the total energy to be less than the total kinetic and potential energy. When there is no friction, no energy will be transformed into heat making the total energy equal kinetic and potential energy. \n\nIn conclusion, we suggest that the drop height of the initial drop should be 3 meters and taller than the hill height. The hill height should be 2 meters and the loop should be 2.50 meters because the loop and hill height have to smaller than the initial drop height.  I chose these heights because the max speed was 7.7 m/s which is right in between 6.7 m/s and 8.4 m/s. We also think the mass of the car should be 60 kg because mass does not affect speed. We hope we gave you enough science and evidence behind our thinking for you to approve our requests.\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "79", "Raw": "69", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.5188", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7913", "Comprehensive": "0.6550", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 14(3), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 20(2), 27(2), 29(2), 34(2), 36(1), 37(1), 42(1), 44(1), 45(1), 46(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Also, you should make the initial drop height 3.5 meters because it allows you to make the next hill as tall as you want as long as it is under 3.5 meters which means that you can make the ride longer and have taller hills and loops.  When the height of the initial drop is taller, you will have more potential energy to transfer into kinetic energy when the ride is going, in my experiment when I made the initial drop 3.5 meters for the first trial, the ride had more potential energy that then gets turned into kinetic energy during the ride.  Some of that energy will also turn into heat on the track as the car is going down the hill because of friction on the ride.  But during my second trial, I made the initial drop 3 meters tall and it had less potential energy that was transferred into kinetic energy and heat on the track during the ride which means that the hills and loops couldn't be as tall as they were during the first trial.  So when the amount of potential energy is higher, the amount of total energy and kinetic energy is higher and the ride can go on longer.  Also, I would make the initial drop as tall as possible with the ride being safe and fun because it will allow the car to have enough potential energy which is the energy an object has while sitting still and you want as much potential energy as possible so you can make the ride as long as possible.\n\nFor the hill I made my hill after the initial drop of 3.5 meters for the first trial and the car didn't make it over because it didn't have enough potential energy to transfer into kinetic energy to make it over the hill.  This is why I made the hill 2.75 meters tall in my second trial and the car made it over because the hill was shorter than my initial drop which was 3.5 meters tall.  This worked because there was more potential energy from the initial drop than kinetic energy used to get over the hill so the car got over the hill just fine.  So if you make the first hill smaller than the initial drop, the car will make it over but you have to make sure that if you put more loops or hills after that, those loops and hills must be smaller than the one that was before it so the car can make it over.  Also, the car won't have as much potential energy at the top of the hills as it did for the ones before that which means that it has less kinetic energy while going down and up the hills which is why the hills and loops must be smaller than the one that came before it because kinetic energy is the amount of energy an object has while it is moving.  So since kinetic energy is the energy an object has while moving it needs to have enough kinetic energy to get over the next hill or loop.\n\nThe loop that I chose in my first trial was also 3.5 meters tall and the car didn't make it over because it didn't have enough kinetic energy to make it around the loop, just like in my first trial for the hill when it was 3.5 meters tall.  The loops work just like the hills in the fact that they can't be taller than the initial drop or the hill or loop that came before it on the ride.  If you want to have multiples hills or loops, I suggest making the initial drop as tall as possible so you can put as many loops and hills on the ride until the end as long as they are shorter than the hill or loop that came before it.\n\nThe mass of the car will affect how much the potential energy and kinetic energy the car has because the heavier it is the more potential energy it has at the top of the initial drop, hills, and loops to transfer into kinetic energy.  So another way to make the ride longer is to have the car be heavier since it will take a longer time for it to slow down and it will have more potential and kinetic energy to make around the hills and loops to the end of the ride.  Also, if the car is lighter it won't have as much potential energy and kinetic energy while going through the ride so the ride can't be as long as it could be when the car is heavier.  For my first trial, I made my car 55 kg. and it had 2668 potential energy at the top of the initial drop and 2667 kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop but when I made the car 45 kg it only had 2209 potential energy at the top of the initial drop and 2208 kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop.  This shows that when the car is heavier it will have more potential energy and kinetic energy to make it around the ride and when the car is lighter it will have less potential energy and kinetic energy to make it around the ride.  The thing is, mass doesn't affect velocity which means that if you are sending more than one car at a time, they won't hit each other since mass doesn't affect the velocity that the cars are going at.  So the cars should always go at the same speed every single time they go through the ride.\n\nThe reason that hills and loops need to be shorter than the initial drop and the hill or the loop before it is because there must be more potential energy at the top of the initial drop and hills than kinetic energy at the bottom of the hills.  There must be more potential energy because that potential energy will start to turn into kinetic energy as the car picks up speed and starts to go downhill since potential energy is for objects that are sitting still and kinetic energy is the energy that the object has while moving.  Also, some of that potential energy will turn into heat or mechanical energy because the friction of the wheels on the track will turn some of that energy into mechanical energy.  So when there is more potential energy at the top of the hill that will be better since it will have a better chance of getting over the next hill since there will be plenty of kinetic energy to get over that hill as long as the hill is shorter than the initial drop of the hill in front of it.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "86", "Raw": "72", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.5414", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.8257", "Comprehensive": "0.6835", "Content Unit": "0(5), 3(5), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 7(4), 9(4), 11(3), 14(3), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 22(2), 23(2), 28(2), 30(2), 32(2), 33(2), 35(2), 37(1), 38(1), 39(1), 42(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 23 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... while the ride is still safe\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 17 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... m s which is in between the safe and fun speeds.\n\t", "sentence 5 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 18 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... meters because it allows you to make the next hill as tall as you\n\t         .................... want as long as it is under.\n\t", "sentence 7 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 28 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... when I made the initial drop\n\t", "sentence 11 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 11 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... when the amount of potential energy is higher\n\t", "sentence 11 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 9 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3957cc3a9535eae137", "class_id": "5", "teacher_id": "PN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "Hello Gonzales family,\n\nI've heard you needed help with a new roller coaster ride. I did a few tests and I think I can help you with your amusement park:\n\nA roller-coaster usually has an initial drop height (and is usually the highest drop) and the one I found that works the best is 5m. This is because of a thing called PE, which is the amount of energy in an object related to its position. The more PE something has, the more KE (how much energy an object has based on its motion) something has and in turn, is how much total energy something has. In my 1st trial, I had the drop height at 2m and the PE at the top gave me 977J (J is how we measure energy in science) and the KE at the top of the hill was 0J since there was no movement. But at the bottom of the hill, I had 977J of KE and only 1J of PE (since it can still move) for a total of 977J of energy (since PE + KE = total energy). But I got even more energy in my 4th and final trial; the top of the initial drop height of 5m: 2,443J of PE and 0J of KE but at the bottom, I had 2,442J of KE and 1J of PE. So I find 5m to be a pretty good initial drop height.\n\nFor an exciting roller-coaster, you would probably want a hill (or multiple hills). With the initial drop height being 5m, I find a hill height of 4m to be the best. 1st of all, if you want a hill, it can't be the same or higher as the initial drop and/or the previous hill; all thanks to a thing called the Law of Conservations of Energy. It might sound fancy but basically, it states that matter can't be created or destroyed, simply turned into a new form (whether it's PE, KE, thermal/heat). Since we won't have any tracks or motors to bring the car up, we won't have any additional help to bring the car up AND over the hill. For my 3rd trial, at 4m, I have 2,448J of PE and 0J of KE at the top but only 1,957J of PE and the top of the hill and 491J of KE at the top of the hill. So why not 5m? Because it's the same height as our initial drop: the PE at the top of the initial drop is 2,450J of PE and 0J of Ke and at the top of the hill, it has 2,431J of PE and only 18J of KE. It simply didn't have enough energy to get the car up AND over the hill.\n\nFor height in general even if it's not in both of the formulas (PE=mxgxh or KE=1/2mxv2), it still affects both. For PE, it's right in the formula (h stands for height) but it still affects KE as well. TE = PE + KE and I already said that PE has a height in its formula but if the height increases, that would increase the PE which then would affect KE since already said, TE = PE + KE, and even though height isn't in the KE formula, it still affects KE because of the formula TE = PE + KE.\n\nAnd finally, we need to know our car mass. I find 60kg works the best when we choose the previously chosen initial height drop. For the 1st trial, I had 40kg as the car mass and PE at the top of the initial drop was 1,955J and the KE at the bottom of the drop was 1,954J for a total of 1,955J of energy. But when the car mass was 60kg, the top of the initial drop was 1,931J of PE and there was 1,930J of KE. The more energy something has, the farther it would go on a roller coaster (like the one you want) where there is no extra help, the farther it would go.\n\nBut it doesn't really matter where the car is because a car with greater mass has more total energy in motion or at rest because of the combo of the PE and the KE. But if you want to know the specifics, the car has the most PE at the highest point because that's where all of the \"potential\" is building up for. And the car has the most KE on the way down the hill since the car is in motion and accelerating.\n\nBut what would the height of the initial drop do with PE or the KE? There are these relationships in science we call inverse and direct relationships. Inverse relationships are when one thing goes up and the other goes down or if one goes down, the other goes up. We don't have an example of that yet but we have many examples of the other relationship: direct. Direct relationships are where one goes up and the other goes up or if one goes down, the other goes down. The PE at the top of the hill and the KE and the bottom of the hill are direct relationships. If you increase the height of the initial drop of hill height, the more energy you would have (the same thing if you were to decrease the height of the initial drop of hill height; the energy would decrease).\n\nBut what about mass and its relationship with PE and KE? Well, like the height of the initial drop or hill affects the PE and KE, the same could be said about the mass. The more mass something has, the greater the PE and KE of a certain object, and in this case, a roller coaster car.\n\nExcept for the fact that gravity (what keeps you from floating in the air) and normal force (what keeps you from going through the floor) exist so all of this is awesome data, but when you go up or down, the PE and the KE is gonna change. When you go up a hill, you're building up that PE, and the KE slowly starts going down. So the opposite could be said when you go down a hill: you build up that KE while the PE slowly (or quickly, depending on how steep the hill is) starts going down.\n\nSo we talked about the relationship between the car's mass and KE/PE but what about the car's mass and energy? Well, the heavier the car mass, the more energy it would have since the KE would be higher. The PE would be based on its (gravitational) positional but KE is based on its motion and as we already know, motion, PE/KE, mass, hill height, initial drop height, and more are all needed for a roller coaster.\n\nNow that we know some relationships and definitions and which heights, there's something else you should know: if the car is heavier, it should affect the speed of the car, right? No, it doesn't. No matter if the car is 40 kg (1st trial) or 60 kg (5th trial), the speed remains the same. This is because both equations can \"cancel out the mass\" and then you're only solving for velocity and since you only have to worry about the gravity and height, it's the same since it's from the same distance.\n\nPreviously, I stated that a drop height of 5m would be best since it gives more energy but after doing a test on drop height and speed, I find that 3.5m works the best for the initial drop because if your roller coaster is 5m, that could take your passengers 9.88m/s2 at any given moment and that's deemed \"unsafe\" so we need to lower the height just a little bit. 4m doesn't work either since that's too fast, taking your passengers at any moment 8.8m/s2 but if you were to have 3.5m, it would only take them 8.27m/s2 and that's deemed \"safe\" so 3.5m is the best choice in regarding safety.\n\nSo let's say we have a 60kg car at the height of 3.5m and the hill height would be 2m, how would that affect the PE, KE, and the TE? Well, as I already said, the higher the hill and/or the drop height, the more PE it would have, and since the PE directs affects the KE, we can say that the TE would be affected by the height and we now know that mass doesn't affect speed and vise versa BUT mass does affect the PE, KE, and TE since it's a direct relationship with height.\n\nSo I keep bringing up PE, KE, and TE, but WHY do they affect each other? Well, to answer that, we need to know about energy transfer and it happens everywhere in our ideas and design. As stated before, the Law of Conservation of Energy states that matter can't be created or destroyed, (we should focus on the 2nd part), only converted from 1 form of energy to another. This basically means that an enclosed space can't create or destroy any matter unless an outside force \"interferes\". This still remains true even if PE or KE is being transferred to thermal energy instead. But this still affects our roller coaster since when you go down a hill, the object has more KE, and the less PE it has so as an object goes up a hill, the KE goes down and PE goes up.\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour science team", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "102", "Raw": "68", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.5113", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7798", "Comprehensive": "0.6455", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 11(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 23(2), 25(2), 27(2), 29(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 39(1), 40(1), 42(1), 46(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

It is important you know what these mean and how energy works. Potential energy is energy that is being stored, this means you are not in motion. The calculation to find potential energy is mass x gravity x height. Kinetic energy is energy that is being used, so you would be in motion. The calculation to find kinetic energy is 1/2mass x velocity^2. The law of conservation of energy says that energy can not be created nor destroyed, so your total amount of energy should stay the same throughout the ride if you are in a non-friction environment. But if you are in a friction environment then you will see that there is more PE than KE at the end of a ride, this is because instead of the PE becoming KE it will actually turn into heat energy due to friction. So even though it may look like the energy just disappeared, it actually just changed into a different kind of energy.\n\nI think that the best height for the initial drop would be 3.5 meters. I think this because height and energy have a direct relationship, meaning the higher the drop is the more energy and speed you will have. The total speed this drop will cause is 8.26 m/s. In order to have a fun ride the speed should be higher than 6.7 m/s, but to have a safe ride the speed should be less than 8.4 m/s. And since this drop will give a speed that is very fast but still safe, it is your best option.\n\nI think that the best hill height for your coaster would be 3 meters. The initial drop height determines the total energy for the ride, and since you can't create energy you have to make sure that all of the hills following the initial drop have a lower height. I performed some trials to find the energy for different hill heights, the following are my findings. I set the initial drop height to 3.5 meters, and when I made my hill height 3 meters I had a kinetic energy of 256 J at the top of the hill. But after I set the hill height to 4 meters the kinetic energy dropped to 21 J and the car didn't make it over the hill. So as you can see, as long as your hill heights are shorter than your initial drop, your coaster will make it to the end just fine.\n\nI don't have a recommended mass that would be best for your car. And this is because mass does not affect speed. In a non-friction environment, PE  is equal to KE. And using this logic we can say MxGxH = 1/2xMxV^2. But during a rollercoaster the mass of the car will not change during the ride, so your new equation would just be GxH = 1/2V^2. Meaning that you can just take mass out of the equation because it won't change the outcome. To put this into perspective, I performed multiple tests and this is what I found. When I made the car mass 40 kg the total speed was 8.83 m/s, but when I made the mass 60 kg the speed was still 8.83. So that is why I don't have a recommended mass because it really doesn't MATTER (get it).", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "3", "Raw": "5", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 15", "Quality": " 0.3333", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.0573", "Comprehensive": "0.1953", "Content Unit": "20(2), 35(2), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 35 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

If you have a higher hill or the same height as the initial drop height, the cart will not make it over the hill. This is because some of the PE/KE changes to a less useful form of energy called heat/thermal energy. \n\nIn my experiments, I had the cart's mass at 50 kg. In one of my test runs, I had the hill height at 2.50 and the initial drop height at 2.00. When I started the test, the cart did not make it over the hill and it rolled back down without finishing the ride. But when I switched the numbers, the cart made it over the hill and finished the ride with no trouble. This shows that you cannot have your hill higher than your initial drop height. \n\nAnd now I need to tell you about the relationships. Mass and PE have a diverse relationship. When mass goes up, PE goes up too. Mass goes down, so does PE. The same with mass and KE. Another diverse relationship is height and PE. As height goes up, PE also goes up. So basically I'm saying that there are a lot of diverse relationships that you need to keep in mind for when making your roller coaster. \n\nNext I'm going to tell you about KE. Kinetic Energy is a form of energy that an object has while it's in motion. This means that when the cart is at the top of the initial drop, the KE is 0 because it isn't moving. When the cart was on the top of the hill, it had a lot of KE since it is actively in motion and not on a flat surface it can rest on. \n\nWhen the hill height was 5 meters, the PE started at 2,449 and it only dropped down to 2424, but it couldn't make it over the hill. Then when you look at 2 meters, the PE was 2445 and dropped down a little lower to 931. This is the perfect amount of energy for your roller coaster.\n\nThis is why I think my roller coaster is a good idea for you to consider. \n\nThanks for your time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  â", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "39", "Raw": "39", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 109", "Quality": " 0.3578", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4472", "Comprehensive": "0.4025", "Content Unit": "3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 10(3), 15(3), 16(3), 18(3), 23(2), 32(2), 33(2), 35(2), 36(1), 50(1), 53(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 10 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3957cc3a9535eae138", "class_id": "5", "teacher_id": "PN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "Hello Gonzales family!\n\nI have found in my research that having an initial drop height of 3.5 m will make the rollercoaster ride the most thrilling and fun but safe at the same time. To find the best height I tested some smaller drops and some larger drops. When I tested the drop height at 2m the PE at the top of the initial drop was only 977 J's and the KE at the bottom was only 977 J, and with a drop height of 5m the PE at the top was 2443 J's and the KE at the bottom was 2442 J's. through this, I have found that the higher the initial drop height is the more PE energy there will be at the top as well as more KE at the bottom, this is a direct relationship because whenever the hill height is increased the PE and KE will always increase as well. Potential energy is stored energy that has the ability to do work and, KE is what an object or a particle has by reason of its motion. The total energy is the amount of KE and PE at a given time, it never changes when there is no friction.  Again I believe that 3.5m is the best choice. \n\nNext, I looked into my trials and I have concluded that having the mass of the roller coaster be 60 kg will make the ride have the most energy and velocity making it very fun. In my trials, I has the initial drop at 5m then, I tested a car that was 40 kg, and the PE at the top of the hill was 1955 J, and the KE at the bottom of the hill was 1954 J. Later, I tested a car the weighed 60 kg and found out that the PE at the top of the hill was 2932 J and the KE at the bottom was 2931 J. This proves that having more weight in the car for the roller coaster will make it more fun because it has more energy.\n\nAlso, I looked into the best first hill height to have after the initial drop. I found that when I made the hill height the same as the initial drop height which was 3.5m, the car would not make it over the hill. then, I tried to make the hill height 3.25m which was a little less than the initial drop and the car made it over. \n\nHere are some things I have found while doing my research. First I noticed that the PE of the coaster at the top of the hill slowly decreases as the car moves downs the drop and the KE which is 0 at the top slowly increases while the car moves down the drop. When the car moves up the hill the PE which is 1 slowly increases and when the car moves uphill the KE which is the total energy slowly decreases. This happens because of the conservation of mass - when one goes up the other has to go down. The total energy will always be the amount of PE there was at the top and it never changes when there is no friction. Energy can not be created or destroyed but it can be changed within a closed system meaning the amount of total energy remains constant. The PE at the top of the hill and the KE energy at the bottom of the hill are related because they both equal the total energy. Mass affects PE because it is in the formula to find PE. PE= MASS x gravity x-height. Mass affects KE because it is in the formula to find KE as well. KE= 0.5( MASS ) x velocity squared. To add to this I noticed that when there is friction added to a rollercoaster the PE will be the same because it has the potential to have that amount of energy, but the KE will change because the KE is the energy during movement and friction only occurs during movement as a resistance. When friction occurs and the car is moving it will create something called thermal energy/heat. When there is no friction the amount of PE will be the same as the total energy but when there is friction the PE will not be the same as the total energy. Height and speed have a direct relationship because the more height something has the faster it will go because when something is higher it takes more time for that thing to get to the ground meaning it will have more time to build up speed. The mass has no relationship with speed meaning that it doesn't matter the mass of something the speed will be the same if they are dropped at the same height.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the drop height should be 3.5m, the mass of the car should be 60 kg, and the first hill height should be 3.25m. \n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "55", "Raw": "57", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 125", "Quality": " 0.4560", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6537", "Comprehensive": "0.5548", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 20(2), 22(2), 27(2), 31(2), 32(2), 33(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 47(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 6 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... the initial drop height is the more PE energy because the PE and\n\t         ....................

The reason I choose the highest possible drop height within the speed limit was that it will increase the total energy. Because the height affects speed,  When the drop height was 5m, the PE at the top and the KE at the bottom were both 2443J. However, when the drop was at a shorter height of 3, there was only 1446J of PE at the top and the same amount for the KE at the bottom. Using this data, you can see that there is a direct relationship between the initial drop and the amount of energy, as stated above. This data doesn't only allow me to find the optimal drop height but also allows me to find other relationships and patterns. One of those relationships is that PE + KE= total energy. This is shown best during the hill trial, where it measured PE and KE at the top of the hill in addition to height. In a trial with a hill height of 2m, the PE at the top of the initial drop(1468J) combined with the KE(0J) was the same as the total energy(1468). This was also the case at the top of the hill when the PE combined with KE to get the total energy of 1468. However, this time the PE was 952J and the KE was 516J. At the bottom, it was the same as the top, but the KE and PE values were switched. This means that whatever the PE at the top is, the bottom is also the same. This also confirms the Law of Conservation of Energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. I know this because the total energy always remained the same. Hill and drop height have a relationship as well. During a trial with an initial drop height set to 3m and a hill height set to 5m, the car didn't make it over the hill. The same thing was true when the hill and drop heights were the same. However, anything less than the initial drop did make it over the hill. From this, you can conclude that the initial drop height must be greater than the hill after it. Finally, there is the relationship between mass and energy, but mass won't affect speed. This can be shown in every trial where mass was changed. In a trial that had a car mass of 40kg, there was only 782J of PE at the top and the same amount(in KE) at the bottom. However, when the mass was 60kg, the PE at the top was 1173J, and the same amount in KE at the bottom. So, there is a direct relationship between mass and total energy.

I have recently taken up your challenge to build a thrilling yet safe roller coaster, and through all the experiments I have done, I have some vital information to share with you.\n          Firstly, I strongly recommend an initial drop height of 3.5 meters tall. Based on my experiments, I have found that height and potential energy have a direct relationship, meaning that as the height goes up, the potential energy will also go up. This is demonstrated in my data because when I made the initial drop height\n     4 meters tall, the potential energy the car had at the top of it was 1960 joules. When I increased the initial drop height to 5 meters, the potential energy the car had at the top was 2443 joules. However, we cannot make the initial drop 4 or 5 meters, because it would go way too fast over the safety speed. I also found that height directly affects speed, so as height goes up, speed also goes up. You can see this when I tested a 5 meter initial drop, and the car was going 9.88 m/s at the bottom of the drop, way exceeding the safety speed. I then tested the initial drop being 3.5 meters tall, and it went just under the safety speed of 8.4 m/s, it went 8.25 m/s, allowing the maximum amount of excitement and fun for the coaster! \n          Potential energy is energy stored in an object based on the object's height, so with more height the more potential energy it has. It is important to have more potential energy, because then as the car goes down the hill, the potential energy turns into kinetic energy, which is energy an object has because of its motion. As the car then goes up a hill, the kinetic energy turns back into potential energy, to be used again later. It is important to have more energy so the car can go for longer, go up higher hills, and make the roller coaster more thrilling.\n          On the topic of hills, I suggest adding a hill of about 3 meters or less in height. According to my research, a hill cannot be higher than the initial drop or the car won't have enough kinetic energy to make its way to the top of it. Considering our initial drop will be 3.5 meters, it is important that the hill is less than that, I suggest around 3 meters because it will still be very thrilling, and it will actually work. Height and kinetic energy are also directly related, as height goes up, the kinetic energy also goes up because the longer something is falling, the more velocity it gathers which gives it more kinetic energy. A hill can't require more kinetic energy to climb than the initial drop gives, because it won't be able to get over it. And according to the law of conservation of energy, you cannot create energy so we cannot create any more kinetic energy for the car, so we will have to have a hill shorter than the initial drop. In my experiment, I tried out a 3 meter hill, and the roller coaster car easily made it over the hill with still enough potential energy to get to the end. However when I tried out taller hills, I tried a 3.5 meter hill, the same as my initial drop, the roller coaster car was not able to make it over it, for it had no more kinetic energy, having used all of it going up the hill.\n          Now talking about the actual roller coaster car, we need to pick how heavy it is. I suggest making the car 60 kilograms. In another one of my experiments, I found out that mass and kinetic energy, and mass and potential energy are directly related, meaning as the mass goes up the potential energy and the kinetic energy also go up. You can see this in my test where I tried out a 40 kilogram car, resulting in a potential energy of 1955 and a kinetic energy of 1955. When I tested out a 60 kilogram car, it had a potential energy of 2932 and a kinetic energy of 2932 meaning that with the more mass the car is, the more energy it has. I also found out that mass has NO EFFECT whatsoever on speed. I tested a car that was 60 kilograms, and it was going 8.25 m/s at the bottom of the drop. I then tested the car with 40 kilograms, and it was going the same speed! Even though mass doesn't affect speed, it is still important to have more energy, and here's why. In the real world, there is friction. Friction turns some of the energy to heat energy, or thermal energy, meaning that some of the energy is lost. This doesn't break the Law of Conservation of Energy however, because the energy is still there, just turned into heat. This problem makes it even more important to have more energy, because some of the energy turns to heat and we need all the energy we can get. Again, the roller coaster car having more energy will make the overall ride way better, the car will be able to climb higher hills, go for longer, go through more loops, and make it a more thrilling experience.\n          Thank you, Gonzales family for offering this fun and thought provoking challenge, and I hope my research has helped you, and your roller coaster is successful! I will certainly check out the roller coaster in person when it is done!", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "15", "Raw": "19", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 59", "Quality": " 0.3220", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.2179", "Comprehensive": "0.2700", "Content Unit": "6(4), 11(3), 15(3), 20(2), 23(2), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 57(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

I think this because as we know height and PE have a direct relationship so the higher the drop is the more PE there will be to start off the ride. As the car moves down the drop the PE is becoming KE, this is good because at the bottom of the initial drop we want the most KE as possible (but still keeping it safe) so the ride keeps going. For example the KE at the top of the initial drop (when the height is 5) is 0, this is because the car isn't moving, by the time the car reaches the bottom the KE is 2442, this is because all the PE at the top has become KE as the car goes down the drop. The total energy at the bottom of the hill 2443 this is because there is still a little PE left over so you do KE+PE= total energy which in this case is 2442+1=2443. The higher the initial drop is the more PE there is at the top.\n\n  A common misconception is that with greater mass the car will go faster but that is actually false. In an environment where there is no friction the mass of a car with 60 kg will go the same speed as a car with 20 kg because in the KE formula it states: 1/2 mass x velocity squared. In the PE formula it states mass x gravity x height. Notice that the only like term in both equations is mass so that shows that mass does not affect either types of energy when they transfer from one to the other which means that mass will not affect the speed of the roller coaster. \n\n  The best hill height is 2.5 meters because as we know the hill cannot be higher than the initial drop which is 3.5 meters. It cannot be higher because the ride will not have enough KE to keep the ride going. Neither heights can too be high or the ride will become almost too fun and cause it to be unsafe like my example in paragraph 1 would be considered unsafe because I was putting the height at 5 but after doing more trials I realized you can't make the drop that high without having the speed go over 8.5 m/s.

First, we have to think about how high the initial drop is. I think think that the initial drop should be 5 meters tall because the higher the drop the more potential energy you will have. Potential energy and drop in height have a direct relationship. This means that when you make the hill higher you will have more potential energy. The same goes for the mass of the car. If you make the cart really heavy then the total energy will be more and the potential energy at the top of the hill will be high but not higher than the total energy. the kinetic energy at the bottom will be the same as the total energy as well. \nThe next thing we have to consider is how tall the hill will be. It can not be higher than the initial drop but we still want it to be fun for the riders. We should make the hill height 3.50 meters tall this way the passengers will be thrilled and they can make it to the top of the hill without going back down the hill. The hill height should be around 2.50 meters tall so that we do not make the ride too fast on the way down and make it unsafe for the passengers. Some people think that the mass of the cart will affect how fast the rollercoaster will go but they are wrong. The mass of the cart can be any weight as long as the coster can hold. We also have to consider the friction that we will have to encounter during the ride. Friction has to be accounted for because it transfers our potential and kinetic energy into heat/thermal energy so that we lose some of that kinetic energy while we are moving.\nSome of my data showed me that when I increased the friction to 0.10 and the mass of the car to 50 kg the kinetic energy was decreased to 6J and the thermal energy was increased to 769J at the top of the hill. when there was no friction the kinetic energy at the top of the hill was 513J and the thermal energy was 0J. When the friction was at its max the cart couldn't make it to the top of the hill because some of the kinetic energy was converted into thermal energy. \nAnother thing that we should know to make a rollercoaster is the relationship between potential energy and kinetic energy. With no friction, the total energy should be the same as the potential energy at the top and the kinetic energy at the bottom. When the cart goes down the hill the potential energy goes down and the kinetic energy goes up until the bottom of the drop and you start to go back up the hill then the potential energy goes up and repeats at the top of the hill. this direct relationship results in us knowing more about energy!\nThat is all you need to know if you want to make a fun and safe roller coaster for your amusement park.\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "40", "Raw": "60", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 110", "Quality": " 0.5455", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6881", "Comprehensive": "0.6168", "Content Unit": "0(5), 3(5), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 13(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 21(2), 22(2), 27(2), 28(2), 38(1), 46(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 28 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... how high the initial drop is\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 11 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: ....................

The reason I recommend an initial drop of 5 meters is because if your drop height is really high, the potential energy at the top and the kinetic energy at the bottom will be much greater. For example, when my initial drop height was 5 meters the potential energy at the top was 2443 J. When my car reached the bottom, the kinetic energy was 2442 J. In another one of my trials, I put the initial drop height at 3.50 meters. When I used that for my initial height the potential energy at the top was 1710 J. When my car reached the bottom the kinetic energy was 1709. As I was going down the 5-meter initial drop, the potential energy was decreasing and the kinetic energy was increasing. At the top of my initial drop, my potential energy was higher than it was at the bottom because potential energy is when the car isn't moving. For example, when my car was at the top of my 5-meter initial drop, the potential energy was 2443. When the car reached the bottom the potential energy went down to 1. When I was at the top of my initial drop the kinetic energy was 0. But as it was going down the hill the kinetic energy was increasing because kinetic energy is when the car is moving. For example, at the top of my 5-meter initial drop the kinetic energy was 0 J, but as it was going down the hill it increased to 2442 J. \n\nI have been doing some different car mass trials and I have come to a conclusion that no matter how heavy or light your car is, it doesn't affect how fast your car goes. For example, when my car was 60 kilograms the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88 m/s. When my car was 40 kilograms the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88 m/s as well. Since the fastest my car can go by the end of the ride has to be less than or equal to 8.4 m/s, I've decided to make my final initial drop 3.5 m and my final hill height 2.5 m. My reason being is that when my initial drop was at 5 m, the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88 m/s which is over 8.4 m/s. When my initial drop was 3.5 m, the speed at the end of the ride was 8.27 m/s which is less than 8.4 m/s. When my initial drop height is higher, the end speed of my car is higher. For example, when my initial drop height was 5 m the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.88 m/s. When my initial drop height was 3.5 m, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.26 m/s. \n\nI have been doing some trials on different hill heights and I recommend a hill height of 4.5 meters. The reason I recommend a hill height of 4.5 meters is because, if the hill height is higher then the potential energy at the top of the initial drop and the kinetic energy at the top of the hill would be higher. For example, my data from my trials show that when my hill height is 4.5 meters high, the potential energy at the top of the initial drop is 2448 J and the kinetic energy at the top of the hill would be 2441 J. The lowest hill height I used in my trials was 3.5 meters. When my hill height was that high the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was only 1711 J and the kinetic energy at the top of the hill was only 1707 J. You just have to make sure that your hill height isn't the same or higher than your initial drop.

To start I would make your drop height 3.5 meters tall. Next, I would have a mass of 50km for your cart. Lastly, I would make the hill height 4 meters tall.\n\n I picked a drop height of 3.5 meters for several reasons. First, It's important to understand that the amount of PE you have at the top of the hill is the total energy you will have throughout the ride. (PE or potential energy is the stored energy in an object.)  So if you want a high hill later you need to make the drop height higher. There is a direct relationship between the height of your initial drop and the PE the car has on top of the drop. This means if you have a higher drop height then you will have more PE at the top and more KE at the bottom. (KE or kinetic energy is the energy an object has as the result of motion.) At the top of the hill, the car will have the most PE in the ride. As the car goes down the ride the PE will go down and the KE will go up. At the bottom of the hill is when the car will have the most KE, but the total energy will stay the same throughout the ride. It's also important to not make your coaster too tall because height and speed have a direct relationship. This means that the higher you make your coaster the faster your cart will go, and although we want the coaster to be fast we also want it to be safe. I decided to make the drop height 3.5 because then the fastest you will go on the ride is 8.25 m/s, which is fun be also safe. \n\nI picked a hill Height of 4 meters tall so that the car would be able to go over the hill without a problem. Since the conservation of energy says the total energy in a closed system can change form but not be created or destroyed. This means that the total amount of energy you have at the top of your initial drop will remain constant throughout the ride. This is unless your coaster has friction, if your car had friction then you may not have as much energy as you started with. This is because if you have friction then some of your energy transfers to thermal energy, so it's not being destroyed just transferred.  This relates to the height of the hill because to go up a hill taller than the initial drop you would need more energy which is not possible. In my trials, the car was able to go over a 4-meter hill with no problem since it is smaller than the initial drop. Another important thing to note is when the car goes down the initial drop, PE goes down and the KE goes up. When you go up to your hill the PE goes back up and the KE goes down, but you will never have more energy than you started with. \n\nFinally, I decided to make the mass of the car 50km for a couple of reasons. In my tests, it showed that the more mass you have the more PE and KE you will have. (this is also a direct relationship). That means the heavier your car is the more total energy you will have. But the more mass you have the more PE you need to go up to your hill so I did not want to car the have too much mass. But it really does not matter too much because mass and speed have no relationship. This means that even if your car is really heaver that should not affect the speed. Even if your car is empty or full of people it should not matter in terms of speed. \n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "53", "Raw": "56", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 123", "Quality": " 0.4553", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6422", "Comprehensive": "0.5487", "Content Unit": "3(5), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 10(3), 15(3), 16(3), 18(3), 20(2), 22(2), 27(2), 30(2), 32(2), 33(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 38(1), 40(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The most important here is the science behind the coaster. It needs to make it to the end of the ride for it to be successful. \n\nLet's start with the initial drop. For this, we want it as high as possible, for not ONLY thrill factors, but it's important. The higher up your initial drop is, the more energy you will get throughout the ride. How does this work? The formula for potential energy is mass*gravity(acceleration)*height. So, the higher something is, that means it gets multiplies by a larger number, which means it is greater. Potential energy is the amount of energy something has, or will be used. We need a lot of energy to make it throughout the ride. \n\nOne of my trials uses an initial drop height of 5 meters. It has 2928 joules worth of potential energy. A different trial has an initial drop height of 2 meters. It's PE amount is 1171 joules. This is considerable difference in energy. \n\nSo, what do we do with this potential energy? Well, first we have to know about the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transferred into different forms. There are different forms of energy, and PE is one of them. Another common form is Kinetic Energy. KE is energy created by movement. PE and KE are usually interchanged. When the coaster is moving, it has less PE, but more KE. \n\nFor example, when the ID is 5m, the PE at the BOTTOM of the drop is only 2 joules! The KE is 2926 joules, because the movement was transferred into energy. Now, at the top of the ID, the PE is 2928 joules. This is the TOTAL amount of energy, since the car isn't moving. When it is, it becomes kinetic energy as well.\n` \n\nFor example, if the PE at the top of the ID is 1000 joules, the halfway point of the drop will be 500 joules for PE, and 500 joules for KE.\n\nThe higher the drop, the more PE the car has. This also means it has more TOTAL ENERGY, since the PE of the unmoving car is the same amount as the TE. This means that it will have more KE at the bottom, which helps the coaster move. \n\nAnother important component of the coaster is reducing as MUCH FRICTION AS POSSIBLE. Friction means that the KE can be transferred into heat/thermal energy, and it cannot be reversed. This is a waste of energy, that could have been used for speed. \n\nThis all shows that our coaster needs a high initial drop, and minimized friction. There is one more important thing we realize. For our hills, it's important that they ARE NOT HIGHER OR THE SAME HEIGHT AS THE ORIGINAL DROP! This is because the coaster will not make it over! Height plays a huge role in PE, so if the amount of energy needed to make it over the first hill is GREATER THAN the height of the original drop, it simply won't be able to.\n\nThis is proven by my data. When the ID height was 5m, and the first hill was 2.50m tall, the car made it over the hill fine. \n\nWhen the ID was 5m, AND the first hill was 5m, the car was NOT able to make it over! This is an important piece of the puzzle.\n\nSo we need minimized friction, a high initial drop, and we need to make sure the hills aren't higher or the same height as the previous. \n\nAnother thing that is important is the mass of the car. Mass is a part of the equation to calculate PE, so again, the higher the mass, the greater the amount of energy. \n\nIn my data, the hill height was 5m every trial. When the car had a mass of 40kg, the PE at the TOP of the ID was 1955 joules. When the car's mass was 60kg, the PE was 2931 joules! This is a way larger amount of PE than the other. We need a car with a large mass to generate more energy. \n\nSo, for our roller coaster strategy, we need a high initial drop, a car with a lot of mass, minimized friction, and to make sure the heights of the hills isn't the same or greater as the previous hills.\n\n\nessay #2 time\n\n\n\nTime to talk about speed. Speed is a very important aspect of the coaster, as it is a factor of fun! People won't have as much fun if it's very slow. So, what makes the ride faster?\n\nThe first part is the initial drop. I learned that the higher the initial drop, the faster the car goes. When the ID height was 5m, the fastest speed was 9.78 m/s, which is far too much to be safe, but it is still very fast.\nWhen the ID height was 2m, the fastest speed was 6.25 m/s. This shows the relation between the speed and height. \n\nThe 2m height is the best speed. This is because it falls between 6.7-8.4m/s, the speed range for it to be safe, but still fun and fast.\n\nNow, you might be wondering, how does the MASS OF THE CAR impact the speed? Let's look at my data.\n\n\nWhen my car mass was 60kg, the fastest speed was 7.93 m/s. When my car mass was 50kg, it's fastest speed was ALSO 7.93m/s!\n\nWhen I did my trials, the speed barely changed. The mass doesn't affect speed, and it's not in the equation. Two things falling at the same time, hit the ground at the same time. The energy changes, the speed doesn't.\nMass does not affect speed because it is not involved in the equation. Speed is distance over time. \n\nIf mass stays the same the whole time, it doesn't have to be involved in the equation. It cancels out on both sides, and the equation still works. Whether mass is increased or decreased, speed stays the same.\n\nWe can lose some of our kinetic energy to thermal energy, but speed is still NOT AFFECTED BY MASS.\n\nFor our roller coaster equation, nothing really changes, but it proves more of our ideas. We want a high ID for speed and energy, a large car mass for energy, minimized friction so we don't lose as much energy to thermal energy, and to make sure the hills/loops aren't higher than the previous drops.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "107", "Raw": "73", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.5489", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.8372", "Comprehensive": "0.6930", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 10(3), 11(3), 14(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 22(2), 27(2), 28(2), 29(2), 31(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 38(1), 39(1), 44(1), 46(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 6 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "6278bd4c14d3319042ba6950", "class_id": "2", "teacher_id": "JP", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "We suggest a roller coaster design that has lots of ups and downs, twists and turns, and spins, and is very unpredictable. While not all things are possible with only the power from the initial drop, but there are definitely things we can work around. \n\nI learned that at the top of the initial drop, there is potential energy (PE), once the car starts going down the hill, it converts to kinetic energy (KE). But the thing you have to remember is the Law of Conservation of Energy, which means that energy can't be created nor destroyed, but it can convert into different types, such as potential, kinetic, sound, heat. But in this experiment we didn't use sound or heat energy. When you add up how much PE and KE you have, you get your total energy, which at all times in the ride will be the same, because the Law of Conservation of Energy. In one of my tests, I had my initial drop set at 3 meters. The PE at the initial drop was 977J, and the KE was 0J. But at the bottom of the drop the PE was 0J and the KE was 977J. The total energy was 977J. As you can see at all times the total amount of energy stayed the same.\n\nBut this gets a little more complicated when you add hills. In order for the car to reach back over the hill after the initial drop, the hill has to be any height under the initial drop height. Because there won't be enough kinetic energy to get you over, and we know that the potential energy converts to kinetic energy.  In one of my tests under \"add a hill\", I had the initial drop height set to 5 meters, and the hill set to 3 meters. And it made it over the hill. The PE at the initial drop was 2446J, and the KE was 0J. At the top of the hill the PE was 1446J and the KE was 980J. The total energy was 2446J. And the initial drop did give enough energy to go over the hill. But when I changed the hill height to 5 meters, some things changed. The PE at the top of the initial drop was 2449J, and the KE was 0J. And the hill the PE was 2445J and the KE was 523J. But there wasn't enough energy to get it back over the hill, because the hill height and initial drop height were the same, and you have to have enough to get it on top of the hill and forward. And when you add multiple hills, the next hill height always has to be less than the previous hill height, in order to sustain the movement of the car. And throughout the ride the energy will just keep switching between potential and kinetic energy.\n\nTo throw in more confusion, you have to consider the mass of the car. When I set the car mass to 40kg the PE at the initial drop was 1958J, and the KE at the bottom was 1955J, the total energy was 1958J. But when I set the mass of the car to 60kg, the PE at the initial drop was 2937J, and the KE at the bottom was 2904, the total was 2937J. This shows that the more mass of the car you have, the greater total energy, which gives you more PE and KE to help you make it through the ride.\n\nAnd in order to have a fun, but safe ride, the ride has to reach any speed in between 6.7 - 8.4 m/s (meters per second). That can be affected by the drop height. From experimenting, I've learned that the higher the initial drop height, the more speed, and the less high drop height produced less speed. When I set the initial drop height to 4 meters, the speed at the end of the ride was 8.84 m/s. And when I set the drop height to 3.6 meters, the speed at the end of the ride was only 8.39 m/s. Which is less. So in our case the 3.6 meter drop height would be the safest, but still be fun, because 8.39 m/s is just under 8.4 m/s, which fits the requirements. \n\nContrary to what I believed before this experiment, the mass of the car does not affect the speed of the ride. When I tested a car that weighed 40 kg, the speed at the end of the ride was 8.38 m/s. And when I tested a car that weighed 60 kg, the speed at the end of the ride was also 8.38 m/s. The formula for velocity (speed with the direction it's going in) is â(2 x gravity x height), mass is not in the equation, therefore it has no effect on the velocity. So knowing this we actually don't have to worry about the weight of the car, to an extent, remember it does affect the energy, and we want more energy, so we do need to give the mass of the car some thought in terms of that.\n\nConsidering all of this information on the physics behind roller coasters, and what it does and does not allow them to do. We can build a roller coaster with many twists, turns, ups, downs, and hills as we want, but we have to be smart about it. We can start with an initial drop that's very high, and throw hills and turns in there but anytime we have a hill it has to be smaller in height than the previous hill, to make sure it makes it over. We also have to have a pretty high drop height, and a car with more mass would be best, to generate the most PE at the start of the initial drop. The speed has to be in between 6.7 and 8.4 m/s. So it's fun but safe. And we have to find the sweet spot for drop heights. Because the higher the drop height, the more speed the ride will have. But the mass of the car will have no effect on the speed of the ride whatsoever. because as we've learned the mass of the car actually has no effect on the speed of the ride.

The mass of the roller coaster car is going to be 60kg, but the mass of the car doesn't affect how fast the car goes.\n\n\nFor the ride to be as fun as possible the initial drop needs as high as possible with the most amount of total energy to ensure that the ride can last for a long time and never come to a stop. We also have to make sure that there isn't too much energy that will make the car go at an unsafe speed. When my initial drop was 2.5 m tall it only had 1217J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop, 1217J of total energy, but when my initial drop height was 5 m tall there was 2443J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop, 2443 J of total energy. So, when the initial drop height is taller there is more total energy to make the ride last and be fun. \n\nAt the top of an initial drop, all of the energy is potential energy, energy than can be used to make the roller coaster car move. Kinetic energy on the other hand is how much energy the car has as its moves. There must always be kinetic energy for the car to go.\n\nTo make sure the roller coaster gets to the end of the track without stopping, every hill must be a little bit shorter than the previous hill because it takes more energy to get up the next hill if it's as tall or taller than the previous one and that is not energy that we have. According to the Laws of Conservation of Energy energy cannot be gained or taken away but can be interpreted in different forms such as kinetic energy, potential energy, and thermal energy. When my initial drop height was 5m tall and the hill was 5m tall there was 0J of kinetic energy. not allowing the car to move forward and in order for the car to get over the hill, there would've needed to be more energy which cannot happen. But when the hill height was 4m tall, shorter than the initial drop, it had 1969J of kinetic energy at the top of the hill allowing it to continue the fun on the ride. \n\nFor my simulation on mass and energy, I had an initial drop height of 5 m and a hill height of 4 m. When I tested my lowest car mass which was 40 m there was only 1956J of potential energy to be used throughout the ride. That is not as much energy as the weight of a 60 kg car on the same track. A 60 kg car had 2934J of potential energy at the initial drop to use on the ride. For all car masses at the bottom of the drop all but one J converted to kinetic energy allows the car to keep going. When my car mass was 40kg for the mass and speed simulation the max speed was 8.33 m/s it was also 8.33 m/s when the car mass was 60kg.

So the higher the first hill the more speed and the more fun the ride is. However to be able to get over the next hill just off of speed the hill would have to be shorter than the initial drop because according to my data when the initial height drop was 3.75J and the hill height was 4m the car was not able to make it over the drop. But when I had the initial drop at 3.75 and the hill height at 3.5 the car was able to make it over the hill and had more energy than when there was when I tried a shorter hill of 2.5m. So for a quick first drop and to pick up speed a large initial drop and a hill a little shorter than the drop is the best option. Another thing to consider is the mass of the car when I changed the mass of the car when it was at 54kg the PE was only 1981 however when I made it to 60kg the PE was 2201 which therefore made more total energy increasing the overall speed making it able to get to the end of the ride without stopping, creating more excitement. Because the more height the more KE there will be at the top of the next hill to keep the car moving. when the car is moving downhill the energy shifts because the PE goes from being the same as the total energy at the top to then being less energy than you have at the initial drop which is why the hill must be shorter than the drop in order to have the car be able to get over without rolling back. The last thing to consider would be in order to make sure completely that the roller coaster is going to make it to the end of the ride without stopping making sure you keep enough energy so the car is able to keep moving. When using the law of conservation of energy I know that energy cant be made or destroyed so you can't make it have a certain amount of energy at the start and you cant remove energy.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the drop height's effect on speed. The taller the initial drop height is the more speed there will be at the end of the ride. According to my data when the drop height was 5m the speed at the end was 9.88m/s, however, when the initial drop was at 3.75m the speed at the end was only 8.56m/s. This is because the higher up the more gravity pulls you down creating more force and making the ride go faster. It also makes the car able to get more speed at the top of the hill if the initial drop is taller because its ability to get over the hill easier because when I had the initial drop at 5m it was able to get over the hill with a speed of 5.4m/s but that is an unsafe speed to have the ride at so we have to lower the initial hill to make the ride safe and still exciting so when I put the initial drop at 3.6 it was able to get over with a speed of 1.41m/s making the ride the fastest but safest design possible while still being exciting. Lastly, you have to consider how the mass and speed is affected. Because when I changed the mass of the car the speed at the end of the ride stayed the same. For example, when the mass of the car was 40kg the speed of the car at the end of the ride was 8.39 and when the mass of the car was 50kg the speed at the end of the ride stayed the same at 8.39. So therefore the mass will not change the overall speed of the ride.

My proposed initial drop height is 5 meters because it gives the car the most energy of 2443J I didn't pick a height lower than that because more energy is more thrilling. The hill I selected is 2 meters tall. It goes the fastest over the hill because it has the most KE of 1462J which will make it faster and more exciting.\nUnfortunately, I cannot make the second hill higher than the initial drop because the law of conservation energy cannot be created or destroyed so that means that the car can't go higher than the point where it started. The more mass you add to the car the for J of energy it has because the mass plays a factor in PE and KE as seen in the formula. If you want it to be a fast ride it is a good idea to start with a very high initial drop height because the higher you make it the more total energy there is, and when the car goes down the hill that PE transfers into KE making the rollercoaster go very fast. I recommend doing many small hills vs big hills because otherwise, the KE will turn into PE going up big hills slowing it down. I can show this because my hill that was 4 meters high had only 487J of kinetic energy going over the hill but my shorter hill of 2m height has 1462J of kinetic energy going over which causes it to be faster. The initial drop heigh affects the rest of the ride because how high you start that's all the energy that you will get so the amount of total energy affects the ride because less total energy causes it to be a slower less exciting ride and more total energy causes it to be a more exciting fast ride. Most importantly this ride will make it to the end without stopping because there are no hills taller than the initial drop.\n\nTo make this a safe ride, the speed needs to stay between 6.7-8.4m/s. The higher the initial drop height of a roller coaster affects the speed increase it,  from my lab the initial drop height of 2.5 m had a max speed of 7m/s but my initial drop of 5 meters has a max speed of 9.88m/s. For the speed to be in the safe zone, I suggest the initial drop height to be 3 meters because then the speed doesn't become dangerous. But it will still be fun because the speed of the roller coaster is still over 6.7m/s.\n \nThe mass will remain the same at 50kg because the Law of Conservation of energy makes it so no energy is created or destroyed. For example, if there's 2000J of PE at the top of the initial drop that will turn into 2000J of KE at the bottom of the initial drop and it will transfer back and forth through the rest of the roller coaster. Even though mass affects the PE and KE it doesn't affect speed because a heavier object needs more energy to fall down the same distance at the same speed than a lighter object to fall at the same height and speed using less energy. So therefore since this is a frictionless environment we don't need to worry about air resistance ultimately resulting in the mass of the roller coaster car not affecting the speed of the proposed roller coaster design.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "46", "Raw": "42", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 116", "Quality": " 0.3621", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4817", "Comprehensive": "0.4219", "Content Unit": "3(5), 6(4), 15(3), 17(3), 19(3), 21(2), 23(2), 27(2), 28(2), 33(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 42(1), 44(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 36 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... because it is tall and\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 6 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "6278bd4c14d3319042ba6958", "class_id": "2", "teacher_id": "JP", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "I would recommend having the tallest initial drop height possible. In my research on initial drop heights and the total amount of energy they have, the 5 meters hill had 2443 Jules of total energy while the 2.5 meters hill had 1222 Jules of total energy. This shows that the higher the initial drop height, the more energy you have.  Total energy is the amount of energy you have in a system, potential energy is the amount of energy an object has because of gravity and kinetic energy is energy an object has because of motion. According to the law of conservation of energy energy cannot be created or destroyed but can flow freely through different states of energy. This means that in a secluded system, the total amount of energy will stay the same, but the type or types of energy in that system can change. This shows that no matter what, the amount of energy you have from the initial drop will always stay the same, but the different types of energy can vary. When the coaster is at the top of the initial drop, all of the energy the coaster has will be potential energy. As the coaster is going down the initial drop though, the potential energy the coaster has will start to switch over to kinetic energy. Then when the coaster gets to the bottom, all the energy will be kinetic energy. If the Gonzales family wants to add a hill to the ride, they need to make the hill smaller than the initial drop height. In my research about hill heights and the coasters ability to go over them, I found that a hill the same height as the initial drop wouldn't make it over the hill but a hill slightly shorter than the initial drop made it over the hill. This shows that if you want to have a hill, it needs to be at least slightly shorter than the initial drop height if you want to make it over without external forces. Finally they need to decide on the mass of the coaster. In my research on Coaster mass and the amount of energy it has at the top of the initial drop, I found that a coaster with 40 kilograms of mass will have 1956 Jules of total energy at the top of the initial drop whereas a 60 kilograms coaster at that same height will have 2934 Jules of total energy. This shows that the amount of mass an object has directly affects the amount of energy it will have at the top of the initial drop.\n\nFor the initial drop height, the more height you have, the more speed you have. In my research, I found that a 2.5 meter initial drop height had 6.99 m/s of speed at the end of the ride whereas a 2.14 meter initial drop only had 6.46 m/s of speed. This shows that the higher the initial drop, the more speed you will get. Also the mass of a coaster and the speed it has aren't correlated. In my research I found that a 40 kilogram coaster going down a 2.5 meter drop had 6.99 m/s of speed and a 60 kilogram coaster on the same drop had 6.99 m/s of speed too. This shows that no matter how much mass you add to the coaster, the speed will still be the same. \n\nIn the end, I would recommend a 2.5 meter initial drop height to not completely bore riders but slow enough to stay within speed limits to keep the ride safe for everyone. Then have a 40 kilogram coaster because the speed would still be the same as a heavier coaster but it would have faster acceleration/deceleration than a heavier coaster because the lighter one would have less momentum. It would also cost less energy to move the coaster up to the initial drop height because the more mass something has, the more energy needed to move it.  For the hill height, have it at 2 meters so people can go over it as fast as possible and have fun.  And last but not least make sure you have something to stop the coaster even if there is friction in the world because the coaster would go forever and have the potential to hurt someone in a friction-less world because of the Law of Conservation of Energy and it could have the potential to hurt someone in a world with friction.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "52", "Raw": "50", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 122", "Quality": " 0.4098", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5734", "Comprehensive": "0.4916", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 11(3), 14(3), 15(3), 17(3), 19(3), 27(2), 29(2), 34(2), 36(1), 42(1), 44(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 11 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: ....................

I learned that the height of the initial drop relates to how much PE and KE are there, when there is a higher initial drop, it allows for more PE to be at the top of the initial drop and allows for more KE at the bottom. When drops are higher, it allows for more energy, which can make more speed. The formula for PE and KE both involve height, with PE being m x g x h, and KE being 1/2H x V^2. I also learned about the relationship between PE, KE, and total energy. Using the LCE, we can see that the total energy throughout the ride does not change, this does allow for PE and KE to change although, so when the ride is going down, the PE is going down and is transferring to KE, when the ride comes back down from a hill or whatever kind of drop, it goes back, and allows for a loop to begin until the end of the ride. An example from my data shows that in one trial of a 5m initial drop height, the total energy started at  2932J, this continued with the end of the ride being at that exact same number. Although this does allow for the other energy to work, the PE at the top of the initial drop was at 2932, at the end it shows that all of the PE was transferred into KE and was at 2932J. Another example of this being shown is when during any test of a roller coaster, the ride always ends with 0-2 PE, and a lot of KE, when the ride initially started, the PE was the highest, and the KE was probably like the PE, this proves how the PE, KE, and total energy relationship work. This affects the ride by allowing for fast speed sways, slow to fast speed changes, and a more exhilarating ride. I also learned how the energy changes when the ride goes down a hill. When the ride starts the PE is most likely at the highest (if a successful ride), when the ride starts to descend the initial drop or hill, the PE is transferred into KE, allowing for the PE to lower as the KE rises. I also learned about how energy is transferred and how the LCE works. The LCE states that energy can not be taken away or added, this means that if the start of the ride has 100J of energy, it will not end at any different number and will always end at 100. How energy transformation works are when the ride is going down a hill, the PE is losing energy and is being moved to KE, when the coaster starts to go up hills, it transfers back into PE. At the end of the ride, you should end up with around 0J of PE, and the rest of the energy in KE. I also learned about the relationship between mass, PE, and KE. When given more mass, you are allowed more energy. An example of this was when I had a car mass of 55kg, the PE at the top of the inital drop was 2699J, also the KE at the bottom of the drop was 2696J. When the car mass was at 40kg, the numbers were significantly lower, with the PE being at 1956J of energy at the top of the initial drop, and the KE at the bottom of the drop is that same number. Using this information we see that the more mass the car is given, the more energy it will have, allowing for faster speeds and a more exciting ride.  Another thing that I learned about is the relationship between hill height and initial drop height. Using data from my Add a Hill work, I can see that when my initial height was set at 5m, some hill heights worked, and some didn't. An example of this is when I used the hil height of 2m, the car was given an easy journey over the hill, having enough energy to make it over the hill, the energy of this was that the KE at the top of the hill was at 1757, allowing for it to trek over the hill with ease. When I had the hill height set at 5m, the car did not make it over the hill, this is because when the initial drop height is not higher than the hill height in the ride, it does not have enough PE to go over the hill. For the 5m hill, I could not record the amount of KE on the top of the hill because it could not make it to the top of the hill. The relationship between the two shows that the height of the hill has to be lower than the height of the initial drop because otherwise there is not enough energy to go over the hill and it will not make it to the end. My final recommendations for the Gonzales family would be to make the roller coaster as high as they can go, this allows for more speed and an exciting ride, I would also recommend that you add hills but not have them be higher than the initial drop because otherwise, they will not make it to the end. I would make the carts as heavy as you can so it allows for more speed. If all of these components are met it would allow for a very fun roller coaster ride and it is my best roller coaster design so far. \n\nUsing data from all of my trials I can help decide what my final roller coaster should look like, it should have a height of 3m, a hill of 2m, and a car mass of 60kg, using this type of coaster it should make it to the end with an exciting yet safe ride. I had to change the initial setup for the roller coaster when it was set at 5,m for the initial drop height because it was too fast and would produce multiple bad things like whiplash. So I had to change it to the fastest but most safe ride. And now for the reasons behind it, I learned that the higher the initial drop height, the more speed your roller coaster will produce. Using data from my trials I can see that when my initial drop height was set at 5m, the speed throughout the ride was 9.88m/s. Although when the height was set at a lower height like 3m, you can see that the speed was lower and at 7.65m/s. I also learned that you cannot have your ride be too fast or else it will lead to worse problems like whiplash, so the safe speeds are at 6.7m/s-8.4m/s, this helps me decide what would be the safest option when deciding the height of my roller coaster. I also learned how the higher the initial drop, the more energy. Along with this, I learned that the mass of the car does not affect the speed of the car at all, but it does affect the amount of PE and KE. I know this because using my data from my trials I can see that when I have my mass set at 60kg, the highest speed throughout the ride was 7.66 m/s, also with this when the mass was set at 50 kg, the speed was the exact same. I also know that mass does not affect speed because the equation for velocity is the square root of 2x height x gravity, it does not involve mass anywhere in that equation, this proves that mass does not affect the speed in a roller coaster ride. Although I do know that the energy was higher due to prior trials. The LCE affects my design because it shows how it cannot add or lose any energy, so that when the energy at the top of the coaster is set, it will stay like that the whole entire ride. The higher the initial drop the more PE you will have at the top and more KE you will have at the bottom, the more PE and KE you have the faster the ride should go. So for my final choice for the Gonzales family I would have a 3m tall initial drop height, a 2m tall hill, and a 60kg car, this would lead to the most fun, yet safe ride you could make from using the data from my trials.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "19", "Raw": "28", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 71", "Quality": " 0.3944", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3211", "Comprehensive": "0.3577", "Content Unit": "3(5), 17(3), 19(3), 23(2), 23(2), 24(2), 27(2), 35(2), 42(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... how the Gonzales family should make a roller coaster\n\t", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 2": "Content Unit: 23 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... a roller coaster that is fast and has a lot of energy\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "6278bd4c14d3319042ba694c", "class_id": "2", "teacher_id": "JP", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "The Gonzales family should have the highest initial drop height that they can because it creates the most energy. For example, in my simulations, the 5m drop height had 2443J of total energy, whereas the 4m drop height has only 1955J of total energy. This proves that the higher the drop height, the more total energy. this is because the higher hill has more potential to pick up speed because it is higher off the ground and that relates to how much KE there is. The PE will transfer to KE when going down the hill but you won't gain or lose any energy because the law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed, but it will switch between forms of energy. The PE, KE, and total energy affect the ride because the more energy you have, the more speed you will have to go up a hill or a loop. \n\nThe next step is adding the hill. I learned from my experiments that the car will make it over the hill as long as the initial drop height is higher than the hill height. One piece of evidence is for the 5m hill and 5m drop height, the car didn't make it over because the drop height is not higher, therefore not enough energy is generated for the car to get over the next hill. But for the 3.5m hill height and 5m drop height, the car has enough total energy to make it over the hill because the hill is smaller than it. \n\nThe final step is the mass of the car. I figured out from my research that the more mass, the more energy the car has. One reason is for the car mass of 50kg and a 5m drop height, it had only 2668J of total energy, but the 60kg car on the 5m drop height had 2932J of total energy. This shows that the mass affects the total energy because it had an outcome on the total energy of the roller coaster. The equations for PE and KE both have mass, so mass affects the amount of energy. The more mass there is, the more the PE and KE because the bigger the number you are multiplying, the bigger the product. The best ride for the Gonzales family is to have the highest initial drop, and then a hill slightly smaller than the initial drop for the car to make it to the end. The ride will be fun because there will be a tall drop at the start so there is more speed for the rest of the ride.\n\nThe initial drop height affects speed because if the height is higher, the car has more track distance to pick up speed before it is at the bottom. I found I'm my simulations that a 3.5m drop height is the best. This is because the speed is less than 8.4m/s but more than 6.7m/s for most of the ride. For example, the 5m drop height had 9.88 m/s of speed at the bottom of the hill and that is way too fast, but the 3.5m drop height had 8.27m/s at the bottom of the drop and that is a safe speed but fast so it is still fun. This is why the 3.5m drop height is the best for safety and fun.\n\nMass does not affect the speed of the roller coaster car. This is because mass is not in the velocity equation, so therefore it has no impact on how fast the car goes. For example with a 60kg car and a 40kg car, they both had 8.27m/s at the bottom of the hill. This shows that the mass does not affect the speed because when there was a 20kg of difference in mass, the speed was still the same. This is because the only thing that affects velocity is gravity and drop height.\n\nAll in all, the Gonzales family should use a roller coaster with a 3.5m drop height, so it isn't too fast for the passengers but still very fast for lots of fun. The Gonzales family should also use a 2m hill because it is more than enough for the car to get over and still has lots of kinetic energy to get the car over the hill. They should also use a 60kg car because even though it won't make the speed higher, it will mean the car has more energy for the car to get over the hill. This is what the Gonzales family should use for their roller coaster to ensure that the ride is safe and fun.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "62", "Raw": "62", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 132", "Quality": " 0.4697", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7110", "Comprehensive": "0.5904", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 23(2), 25(2), 27(2), 28(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 37(1), 38(1), 42(1), 46(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 34 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... that they can because it creates the most energy\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... whereas the m drop height has only J of total energy\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Our height is 5.00m tall because the taller the height of the initial drop, the more PE at the top, and the more KE at the bottom. For example, when I tested the height of the initial drop and amount of PE and KE I found that the ride with an initial drop of 2.00m only had 821 PE at the top and 821 KE at the bottom, but the ride with an Initial height of 5.00m had 2052 PE at the top and 2052 KE at the bottom. This shows that the higher the initial drop height, the more PE and KE will be present which will ultimately make our ride more exciting. The PE and KE added together will equal the amount of total energy there is in the ride, and the amount of PE at the top of the initial drop will be the same as the KE at the bottom of the ride, The more energy, the easier it will be for the car to make it to the end of the ride. The car will lose PE and gain KE when it starts to go down a hill because when the car starts to go down a hill it loses the amount of potential, which adds to the amount of kinetic energy because the car is in motion. The amount of PE and KE will still equal the amount of total energy because the Law of Conservation of Energy states that you can not add nor take away energy from anything. This is true because when I tested the amount of KE and PE in different rides it always equaled the total energy no matter where the car was on the ride. If you want to make a working roller coaster with a hill in it the hill would have to be less tall than the initial drop. The car would not have enough energy to make it back to the top of the ride even if they are the same height. I know this because when I tested adding hills to my roller coaster with an initial drop of 5.00m, I found that every design with a hill under 5.00m made it to the end of the ride (hill height of 2,3,4m), but when the hill height was 5 or greater, the car couldn't make it to the end of the ride. When you increase the mass of the car on the ride, the amount of PE and KE will increase. I know this because when I tested different masses of cars on the same initial drop height I found that as the car mass increased, the amount of PE and KE increased. For example, a car with a mass of 45kg only has a PE of 2209 at the top of the initial drop and a KE of 2209 at the bottom of the initial drop, but a car with a mass of 60kg had a PE of 2931 at the top of the initial drop and a KE of 2931 at the bottom of the initial drop. This shows that the more the mass of the car is, the higher the PE and KE will be. My team's roller coaster is focused on having the most amount of total energy to result in the car making it to the end of the ride every time, and just making the ride as fun as possible.\n\nOur team recommends an initial drop height of 3m because this is the highest initial drop height that we can have for it to be a safe experience but also fun. Our hill height will be 2.5m and our loop height will be 2m. These heights allow for our car to make it to the end of the ride safely but it will also allow for the ride to be fun and fast. The weight of our car will be 60kg because that is the largest that we can go to, allowing the maximum amount of energy to be present. The higher the initial drop height is, the more total energy there will be. For example, when I tested different initial drop heights and the speeds I found that the highest initial drop height (5m) had the highest speed at the bottom of the drop (9.88 m/s) and the highest speed at the top of the hill (7.69 m/s). The higher the mass of the car is, the more energy there will be, but the amount of mass does not affect the speed, seeing as mass is not in the equation for calculating velocity. For example, when I tested different masses of cars and the amount of speed they produced I found that all of the car masses I tested (45kg, 50kg, 55kg, and 60kg) all had the same amount of speed at the bottom of the drop (7.66 m/s) and the same speed at the top of the hill (4.41 m/s). We still chose the highest mass available (60kg) because it allows us to have the highest amount of PE which will transform into KE because of the Law of Conservation of Energy.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "63", "Raw": "63", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.4737", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7225", "Comprehensive": "0.5981", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 25(2), 27(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 17 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... m, and a car mass of kg.\n\t", "sentence 10 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 60 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

It will make it to the end without stopping because the hill is lower than the initial drop and the car allows it to have enough kinetic energy. My initial drop is the best option because it had the highest total energy. With a height of 2m, my first trial had 782 total energy (782 potential energy and 0 kinetic energy at the top, 0 potential energy and 781 kinetic energy at the bottom). With a height of 3.5m, my second trial had 1368 total energy (1368 potential energy and 0 kinetic energy at the top, 1 potential energy and 1368 kinetic energy at the bottom). My third trial, with a height of 5m, had 1955 total energy (1955 potential energy and 0 kinetic energy at the top, 0 potential energy and 1955 kinetic energy at the bottom). My hill is the best height since it is still high but not high enough that the car doesn't make it to the end of the roller coaster. My first hill was the same height as the initial drop and didn't make it to the end. My second hill had a total energy of 1156 and made it to the end. My third hill, and the hill that ended up being my best, had a total energy of 1958 and made it to the end. My car mass is best because it had the most total energy. My first car, with a mass of 50kg, had a total energy of 2448. My second car, with a mass of 50kg, had a total energy of 1956. My third car, with a mass of 60kg, had a total energy of 2934 (which is why I chose my third car).\n\n\nThe higher the initial drop height, the faster the car is moving by the bottom of the drop. The car's mass does not affect the speed it's going. Mass is not in the equation to find speed, therefore it does not have an impact on the speed of the car. For example 10kg x 9.8m/s^2 x 100m = 1/2(10kg) x 8.31m/s^2. Mass cancels out mass, so there's no need to insert it on both sides of the equation. It is removed from the equation altogether. For example, a car on an initial drop height of 5m is going 9.88m/s by the bottom of the drop and the same car on an initial drop of 4m is going 8.27m/s by the bottom of the drop. The safe speeds on a roller coaster are from 6.7 to 8.4m/s and my final speed by the end of my roller coaster was 8.27m/s. This means it's still on the faster end of the safe speeds while still remaining fun.

In the data, it shows that a 60kg car will have 2933 total energy and a 40kg car only has 1958 total energy which means the more mass something has, the faster it will move and the more gravity will pull it to the ground as it goes down.   I also suggest that you start with a very high initial drop to have as much PE as possible and gain enough KE. I found that the best height is 5 meters to get the most PE and KE of 2937 instead of 977 like the 2-meter tall drop did. The higher the initial drop is, the more PE there is, and then as it goes down, the more KE there will be because the PE is transferred to KE as the Law of Conservation says. After that, you should have a hill that cannot that is higher than the Initial drop because as my data shows, even if the hill is .02 meters higher, the car will not be able to gain enough speed no matter the weight of the car. Since the initial drop starts with a lot of PE and no KE, the bottom of the hill with have little to no PE and just about the same KE as the PE at the top because the PE will be converted to KE as you go down as it says in the Law of Conservation of Energy. \n\nAnother suggestion to the Gonzales family for their roller coaster is that to make the car make it to the end at a safe speed between 6.7-8.4m/s the initial drop should be below 4m which also means the hill should be less than 4 but the initial drop cannot be too high because then the PE with being too high which means KE will be too high making it go too fast. I know because when my initial drop was above 4, the speed was about 9.88m/s which is faster than the safe boundary. I also found that if there is no friction the PE at the top is equal to the KE at the bottom but the heavier something is, the more energy it will have but it will still go at the same speed. So although the mass may be different, the energy will be the only thing that changes and the heavier something is, the farther it will be able to go even though it goes at the same speed. For example 10kg x 9.8m/s^2 x 100m=1/2(10kg)x 8.31m/s and if they cancel out, mass will not be in the equation. Gravity x height = 1/2 x velocity^2. Therefore the mass of the car does not affect speed just the amount of PE transfers to KE. I know because the speed at each stop is the same whether the mass of the car is larger or smaller. I know because a 40kg car has 7.64 and so does the 60 kg car. But the height of the initial drop does impact the speed because the more PE, the more the equation will equal and the more KE it will have so the best roller coaster should start with a higher initial drop such as 3 and the car should have a mass of 50kg so that the PE will last longer and convert to KE slower.\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "8", "Raw": "13", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 36", "Quality": " 0.3611", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.1491", "Comprehensive": "0.2551", "Content Unit": "3(5), 18(3), 20(2), 42(1), 50(1), 57(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... a kg car only has total energy which means the more mass something\n\t         .................... has, the faster it will move and the more gravity will pull it to\n\t         .................... the ground as it goes down.\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 20 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "6278bd4c14d3319042ba6949", "class_id": "2", "teacher_id": "JP", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "Currently, my roller coaster has an initial drop height of 5m because mass directly relates to the equation of PE and KE. The equation is mass x height x gravity. So the higher a roller coaster is, the more energy it will have. For example in trial 1 of the initial drop, I had a drop height of 5 meters and a mass of the coaster of 50 kg. Substitute these values into the equation of potential energy and it would equate to 2450 joules of energy. Now in trial 4, my initial drop height was 2 meters, and if you substitute that height into the equation from before it would equate to 977 joules of energy. This proves the higher a roller coaster's initial drop is the more energy it would have. After the initial drop of my coaster, all potential energy would then convert to kinetic energy. Potential and kinetic energy can interchange, although the total energy cannot change due to the conservation of energy law. For example in my first trial of the Initial drop, all energy at the beginning was potential, but as it went down the drop the velocity rose, and the height lowered. This causes an increase in kinetic energy while there is a decrease in potential energy. As a coaster goes higher it will gain potential energy and lose kinetic energy, but as it goes down it is the opposite. Since height is part of the equation of potential energy, when the roller coaster reaches the end it will have no more potential energy.  This is because when going up a hill the velocity will decrease because of gravity pulling on the rollercoaster, so kinetic energy will decrease. At the same time, the height will rise so potential energy will rise. If you decide to add a hill the hill has to be lower than the initial drop height. This is because not only does it need the energy to go up, but it also needs the energy to go forward, so if the hill height and drop height are the same it would cause the roller coaster to roll back. For example, in my first trial of Add a hill, I set the hill height to 5 meters, and as the rollercoaster went up it stopped at the top of the hill and rolled back, but when I decreased the height of the hill the rollercoaster could make it over the hill. Mass helps determine potential energy and kinetic energy in both equations. The more mass a the rollercoaster has it will have more potential energy. Mass also plays a role in the kinetic energy equation, which is 1/2 mass x velocity^2 so in turn, it will also have more kinetic energy.\n\nWhile the last roller coaster design was not safe, a roller coaster with an initial drop height of 3.53 and hill height of 3.59 will suffice as it is a safe speed for roller coaster participants and is still fast enough to be exciting. For example in drop height and speed trial 1 my original design traveled at a speed of 9.89 m/s at the bottom of the drop, which is not a speed that is safe for riders. In my fourth trial, I set the initial drop height to 3.53 and it had a speed of 3.27 which is safe for riders and still exciting. This data also proves that the higher the initial drop is set to, the more speed that the roller coaster will have. In my original design, my roller coaster car had a mass of 50kg, and now throughout testing, I have found that 60 kg will give the roller coaster more energy but not more speed. This is because mass is not in the equation of velocity, so mass would have no effect on it. For example, in trial 1 I had a coaster that weighed 40kg and the speed at the bottom of the initial drop was 8.31, but in my 3rd trial I set my roller coaster's weight to 60kg and the speed at the bottom of the drop was still 8.31. As for my hill, since an initial drop of 3.53 meters would not make it up a 5-meter hill, I had to adjust accordingly. I then set my hill height to 3.49 meters so my coaster would make it up. On a hill at this height during my trials of mass and speed, all coaster weight had a speed of .73 m/s at the top.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "61", "Raw": "71", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 131", "Quality": " 0.5420", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.8142", "Comprehensive": "0.6781", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 9(4), 10(3), 11(3), 14(3), 15(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 32(2), 33(2), 35(2), 36(1), 40(1), 42(1), 47(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 47 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Our coaster started with about 2937J of PE when at the top of the initial drop and about 2936J at the bottom of the ride (which is still above the ground). The total energy of a rollercoaster never changes and is almost always if not always the same as the PE at the top of the initial drop (2937J). As the car goes down, the PE is converted into KE (with no friction) so that at the bottom of the hill there is about 2936J of KE (which is probably only different because of decimals or equations run through the system). The total energy stays at 2937J the whole ride and is just converted into different amounts of energy throughout the ride. For example, there could be 3000J of total energy and when you are almost at the bottom there are 250J of PE and 2750 of KE. That also shows how the PE and KE change throughout the ride. As you go up a hill, the PE increases (up to the original) and the KE decreases, and as you go down, the KE increases and PE decreases. As I slightly explained earlier, the law of conversation of energy explains how energy can't be created or destroyed, which is why as you go throughout the ride the KE and PE convert to each other. Also, if there is friction involved some of that energy will turn into thermal energy. I learned that to go over a hill, the hill has to be shorter than the initial drop because you need to have enough energy to go over the next hill and since energy cannot be created you cannot gain more energy to go over a hill. In my learning, I chose the highest hill that I tested that the car could go over (4m). My initial drop was at 5m so I was able to go over it. This is because my PE started at 2937, which then converted into 2937J of KE at the bottom and converted back into potential energy at the top. The hill was slightly shorter, so the PE lessened by about 600J which was converted into KE when at the top of the hill. I learned that every new hill that the car goes over is like a new initial drop that starts over with new PE. I also learned that the more mass my car has, then the more PE and KE there will be going through the ride. In my learning, a car at 40kg had 1958J of PE at the top of the hill which as I said earlier converted into 1958J of KE at the bottom. This was different when my car was 60kg, which made it have 2937J of PE at the top of the hill and 2937KE at the bottom of the hill. This happens because the equation for PE is MASS x height x speed/gravity.\n\nMy final roller coaster design has an initial drop height of 3m, a hill height of 2m, and a car mass of 60kg. This was made to be the most exciting, yet safe ride possible. We learned that the taller your initial hill is, the more speed your car will have. This would make sense to have the hill at 5m then because it would go at 9.8m/s, but we learned that the safest yet most exciting roller coaster would have a top speed of about 6.7 - 8.4m/s. This shows why our initial height has to be 3m as it is the most exciting speed that is still safe (7.65m/s). We changed our hill height to 2m so that the car would be able to go over it because as we learned earlier, the hill height has to be lower than the initial drop height. We also learned that mass does not affect speed. This was shown in my data when my car had a speed of 7.65m/s at 40kg and at 60kg. This is explained by the equations of PE and KE. PE = height x gravity x mass. KE = 1/2mass x velocity^2. If you get rid of mass and multiply it by 2 you get height x gravity = PE and KE = velocity^2. Do the square root and you get the square root of 2x height x gravity = velocity which does not have any mass in the equation. Mass does not affect velocity. The higher the initial drop is, the more PE you have and KE at the bottom, and also the speed increases, so as the total energy/height goes up, the velocity will go up. This is kind of weird with mass but mass does not affect the speed. The LCE explains that energy cannot be created or destroyed which is why the most total energy that your car has, the more PE, KE, and velocity your car will have. This is why my design has an initial drop height of 3m, a hill height of 2m, and a mass of 60kg.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "69", "Raw": "43", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.3233", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4931", "Comprehensive": "0.4082", "Content Unit": "3(5), 4(4), 11(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 22(2), 27(2), 29(2), 32(2), 33(2), 35(2), 42(1), 46(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 60 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "6278bd4c14d3319042ba6948", "class_id": "2", "teacher_id": "JP", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": " The initial drop of a roller coaster is extremely important, as it creates the energy needed for the rest of the ride. A higher initial drop height will increase the amount of total energy in the ride. This is because increased height will increase potential energy. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred from one form to another. This means that the increased potential energy from the height of the initial drop will not dissipate, and will instead transform into kinetic energy (or movement energy). Potential and kinetic energy will always add up to the total amount of energy (if there is not friction), and energy will transform between these potential and kinetic throughout the ride. An example of this is the difference in energy between a 2.5 meter initial drop height and a 5 meter initial drop height. The ride with an initial drop height of 2.5 meters had 1222 J of potential energy at the top, and 1221 J of kinetic energy at the bottom. In comparison, the 5 meter initial drop had 2443 J of potential energy at the top, and 2442 J of kinetic energy at the bottom. This shows that increasing the height of the initial drop will also increase the amount of energy that a ride has. This is also an example of how potential energy will transform into kinetic energy as the car moves down the hill. At the bottom of both rides, all but 1 J of potential energy had transformed into kinetic energy. With no friction, the amount of potential energy an object has is equal to its kinetic energy at maximum velocity. \n\n One way to make a ride more fun is to add a hill. However, there are limitations on hill height. All hills have to be lower in height than the initial drop. This is because the roller coaster car only gets enough energy from the initial drop to match the initial drop height, which is not enough to continue forward over a hill or equal height or reach the top of a hill taller than the initial drop. An example of this comes from the difference between two rides with a 5 meter initial drop height; one with a hill that is 4 meters tall and one with a hill that is 5 meters tall. The ride with a 4 meter hill made it to the end. However, the ride with a 5 meter hill did not make it over the top of the hill, coming just short of the top before falling backward. This shows that hill height has to be lower than the initial drop height, since the roller coaster car will not have enough energy to make it over a hill that is of an equal or greater height. \n\n Another way to increase the amount of energy in a ride is to increase the mass of the roller coaster car. Because the formula for both kinetic and potential energy involves multiplying by the mass of the object, increasing the mass will also increase energy. An example of this comes from the difference in energy between a car with a 40 kg weight and a 60 kg weight. The car with a weight of 40 kg had 1958 J of total energy. The car that weighed 60 kg, however, had 2937 J of total energy. This demonstrates that increasing the mass of an object also increases the amount of energy it has. An increase of 20 kg led to a 979 J increase in total energy.\n\n Having a fun, safe ride requires having a good amount of speed. Having a speed of between 6.7 m/s and 8.4 m/s is important in making sure that people have fun on the ride, without risking anyone's safety. The height of the initial drop is one factor that has an impact on speed. A higher initial drop height will increase the speed of the roller coaster car. An example of this is the difference in speed between a ride with a 2.5 meter initial drop and a 5 meter initial drop. The car with an initial drop of 2.5 meters had a speed of 6.99 m/s at the end of the ride, while the car with a 5 meter drop had a speed of 9.88 meters at the end of the ride. This shows that increasing the height of the initial drop will increase the speed of the car during the ride. Because we want a fun and safe ride, the goal is to get close to a speed of 8.4 m/s at some point during the ride, without exceeding that speed. The best initial drop height, following that criteria, is 3 meters. This is because it has a maximum speed of 7.66 m/s during the ride, while the next highest speed was an initial drop of 4 meters, at 8.84 m/s. 8.84 m/s is too fast to be safe, so the 3 meter initial drop height is the best option to have a fun, safe ride.\n\n It is also important to understand the relationship between mass and speed. The mass of a roller coaster car has no impact on its speed, only on its energy. This is because the formula for both potential AND kinetic energy multiply by the mass, and can cancel out. Kinetic energy is impacted the same amount as potential energy by mass, and because of the Law of Conservation of Energy, these two types of energy are equal to each other. This means that you can take mass out of both sides of the equation, and can simplify it down to see that velocity (and speed) are not impacted by the mass of an object. This makes sense, because a heavier object will require more energy to get moving than a lighter object. This means that, in general, the mass of a roller coaster car will not have an impact on its speed.

We say this because the roller coaster goes very far, has many hills, and has a tall initial drop. Based on what I have learned, I would make a roller coaster with an initial drop of 5.00m, because 5.00m had 2052J potential energy which was the highest amount of energy leading to the most kinetic energy and total energy, compared to the initial drop of 2.00m, which only had 821J of potential energy. I would make the car weigh 60kg because the more weight the car has, the more potential energy the car would have at its initial drop, leading to more potential energy and kinetic energy. I know this because, during my testing, the car that weighed 60kg had 2931J of potential energy at its initial drop, compared to the car that weighed 45kg, which only had 2209J of potential energy at its initial drop. Having a lot of potential energy leads to having a lot of kinetic energy because the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be gained or lost, it can only be transferred, so as the car is traveling down the initial drop, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, allowing it to go forward and go up the hill. Having a lot of kinetic energy is good in this situation because it makes the car go further and allows it to go over many hills. To make the car go a long distance, the first hill has to be smaller than the initial drop, and the next hill has to be smaller than the first hill, and so on. I know this because, in my testing, all of the hills that were smaller than the initial drop were able to make it over the hill, while the final car was not able to make it over the hill. This is because the final car made it to the top of the hill, but didn't have the kinetic energy to push the car forward, making it go over the hill. \n\nOur team recommends a drop height of 3.00m because this drop height gives us the most speed, and still is in the safe zone, while still giving us enough PE and KE to get us over the hill and loop. We will have the mass of the car be 60kg because that is the most weight the car can have, and the higher mass of the car, the more PE it will have. The loop just has to be smaller than the hill height so we will have a hill height of 2.5m because it is smaller than the 3.00m drop height, and we will have a loop height of 2.00m because it is smaller than the 2.5m hill height. The weight of the car doesn't affect the speed, because mass is not in the formula for velocity, which is proven by the evidence that I have.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "6278bd4c14d3319042ba6945", "class_id": "2", "teacher_id": "JP", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "I would suggest that the Gonzales family construct a roller coaster with a high initial drop and lots of hills. These hills would have to be shorter than the former in order for the cart to make it to the end of the ride. These numerous hills and turns would have to be unpredictable and spontaneous to help build excitement. \n\nFirst of all, the roller coaster should have a high initial drop. This is because the higher the initial drop, the more potential energy at the top. For example, an initial drop of 2m has a PE of 856J at the top of the initial drop, whereas an initial drop of 4.73m has 2023J PE. This means that a car with a higher initial drop will have more potential energy, which will transfer into kinetic energy throughout the ride. This will lead to higher kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop. A 2.93m initial drop has 1255J KE at the bottom of the initial drop, whereas a 4.12 initial drop has 1761J KE at the bottom of the initial drop. As for determining the height of the initial drop, it should be high. This will produce more PE at the top, KE at the bottom, and total energy overall.\n\nNext, the Gonzales family would need to determine hill heights for the roller coaster. In order for the car to make it to the end of the ride without stopping, the hills would have to be shorter than the initial drop and the hill before it. This is because the car will not have enough energy to make it to the top of the hill and over it if the hill is the same height or taller than the initial drop. This can be seen through different hill heights on an initial drop of 4.73m. For example, a hill height of 3.24m had 1404J PE on top of the hill and made it to the end. A 4.9m hill height had 2030J PE at its closest point to the top of the hill and didn't make it to the end of the ride. This means that the first hill, and all following hills, would have to be shorter than the initial drop in order for the car to make it to the end of the ride. Potential energy transfers into kinetic energy as the car travels down the initial drop and down the hill. On the contrary, kinetic energy transfers into potential energy as the car travels up the hill. \n\nPE and Ke are also affected by different heights. For example, a hill with a height of 2m had 2043J of KE at the top, whereas a hill with a height of 4.36m had 151J KE at the top. This means that the higher the hill, the less kinetic energy at the top. Also, the higher the hill, the more PE at the top. The 2m hill had 848J PE at the top, whereas the 4.36m hill had 1894J PE at the top. This also relates to the law of conservation of energy because the total energy for the ride with the 2m hill was 2043J and 2046J for the 4.36m hill.\n\nHeights and hills aren't the only things that affect potential and kinetic energy, however. Mass also has an impact on KE and PE. For example, on a track with an initial drop height of 4.73m and a hill height of 4.36m, a car weighing 42kg had 1499J PE at the top of the initial drop and 1940J KE at the bottom, whereas a car weighing 57kg had 2638J PE at the top of the initial drop and 2634J KE at the bottom. This means that mass has an impact on energy. As you increase the mass, you increase the amount of potential energy on top of the initial drop and the kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop. So, the roller coaster should have a car with a heavier mass to gain more energy.\n\n\n\n\nIn order for the ride to be enjoyable, the Gonzalez family will want to increase the speed of their roller coaster. When you increase the initial drop height, the speed of the ride also increases. This can be seen through a trial of different initial drop heights with a 3.24m hill and 57kg car. An initial drop of 3.49m had 8.26 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop, whereas an initial drop of 4.53m had 9.41 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop. This means that a higher initial drop will produce higher speeds on the Gonzalez's roller coaster. This could be negative though, as a too high drop could produce speeds over 8.4 m/s, which are too fast to be safe. \n\nThe mass of the car has no effect on speed, so the Gonzalez can choose a car that suits the rollercoaster. Mass' effect on speed can be shown through an experiment with an initial drop height of 3.49m and a hill height of 3.24m. A car with a mass of 43kg has a speed of 8.24 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop, whereas a car with a mass of 58kg also has a speed of 8.24 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop. Mass is also not in the speed formula, which means it would have no impact on speed. The energy will change based on mass, but the speed will not. This means that the weight of the car has no effect on the enjoyment of the ride.\n\nEven though the mass doesn't affect the speed of the car, the right initial drop height needs to be selected so the ride can be fun (over 6.7 m/s at least one point in the ride) and safe (never going past 8.4 m/s). For those reasons, the Gonzalez family would have to choose an initial drop and hill height low enough to be safe, but can also be fast enough to be enjoyable. The only drop height that satisfied this was the initial drop height of 3.49m, a 3.24m hill, and a car weighing 57kg. This track went 8.26 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop and 2.18 m/s at the top of the hill. This track meets both requirements for safety and enjoyment, so I recommend it to the Gonzalez family.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "88", "Raw": "66", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.4962", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7569", "Comprehensive": "0.6266", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 9(4), 10(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 23(2), 26(2), 27(2), 28(2), 31(2), 32(2), 35(2), 42(1), 46(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 8 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "6278bd4c14d3319042ba695a", "class_id": "2", "teacher_id": "JP", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "I would recommend that the Gonzales family picks the ride that has the highest initial drop because then there's more PE available to convert into KE allowing for more energy to get the coaster car up hills for a more exciting ride. When the initial drop was at 2.5m there was 1222J of PE at the top and 1221J of KE at the bottom, but when the initial drop height was at 5m, there was 2443J of PE at the top and 2442J of KE at the bottom, meaning there's more energy to make the roller coaster car go faster. It's like this because there's more available energy the higher the coaster car is off of the ground, therefore creating more KE as the car goes down resulting in a higher speed. The amount of PE of the coaster car at the top of the initial drop is the highest the PE will be because that's the highest point of the roller coaster, but the amount of KE by the end of the ride is the highest it will be because then there's the least amount of PE available. The total energy is also the amount of PE at the top of the initial drop before the ride begins because there's the same amount of energy for the whole ride it just changes between KE and PE. The farther down the hill, the higher the KE gets because the coaster car builds up velocity, and the lower the PE gets because the coaster car loses the height it had at the top. \nWhen choosing a hill height, be sure it's not the same height or taller than the initial drop because there isn't enough energy to get the coaster car up and over the hill so the ride won't make it to the end, but if you pick a shorter hill height the car will be able to make it over the hill. For example, when the initial drop height and hill height were 5m there were 2449J of total energy but the coaster car didn't make it to the end of the ride. On the other hand, when the initial drop height was 5m and the hill height was 4.5m, the total energy was at 2448J and the coaster car did make it to the end of the ride. This is because some of the PE at the beginning of the ride transforms into KE which helps boost the car up over the hill where the KE transforms into PE as the car goes back up. The process repeats for however many hills there may be on the roller coaster. \nNot only is the height of the initial drop and hills important but the mass of the coaster car is too. When the car mass was 45kg, there was only 2719J of energy for the roller coaster with an initial drop height of 5m and a hill height of 4.5m, but when the mass of the car was 60kg there was 2934J of energy for the same ride. Along with finding the highest height possible, you want the coaster car to have a higher mass. In conclusion, the Gonzales family should ride a roller coaster that has an initial drop height of 5m, a hill height of 4.5m, and a roller coaster car that has a mass of 60kg because that roller coaster will have the most amount of energy available so they can have the most fun.\n\nThe height of the initial drop affects the amount of energy the roller coaster has, it also affected how fast the coaster car was going. The safe speed range is between 6.7m/s and 8.4m/s. When the initial drop was 5m and the hill was 4.5m the highest speed was 9.87m/s which wouldn't be safe for riders, but when the initial drop was 3.5m and the hill was 3.25m, the highest speed was 8.27m/s which is in the safe speed range. Even though the roller coaster with a 5m initial drop creates more energy, it's not very safe which is more important than the amount of total energy the roller coaster creates. \nThe mass also affected the amount of energy the roller coaster had, but unlike height, the mass doesn't affect the speed at all. When the mass of the car was 40kg the speed of the car was 8.27m/s at the end of the ride, a ", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "55", "Raw": "42", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 125", "Quality": " 0.3360", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4817", "Comprehensive": "0.4088", "Content Unit": "3(5), 6(4), 10(3), 17(3), 19(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 28(2), 32(2), 35(2), 38(1), 42(1), 46(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 6 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: .................... that has the highest initial drop because then theres more PE\n\t         .................... available to convert into KE allowing for more energy to get the\n\t         .................... coaster car up hills for a more exciting ride\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 28 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

If the initial drop of the ride is around 5.00m and the hill height is 5.00m then the coaster car of the ride will not have enough energy from the initial drop to make it over the hill. The relationship between mass, potential energy and kinetic energy is when the mass of the car is higher, the potential energy and kinetic energy are higher. When the mass is lower, the potential energy and kinetic energy is lower. There is not very much change in speed when you change the mass of the car. The difference is really only around 6-7 seconds so it's not much of a difference. In the data of Mass and Energy data, it shows that if the coaster car mass is above 50J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop it is more than the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop.\n\nMy recommendation to the Gonzales family would be to have an initial drop height of 3.50m. After the initial drop, I would recommend a hill with a height of 3.00m, then I would recommend another hill with a height of 2.50m. I would recommend any car mass. I would recommend a initial drop height of 3.00m because as explained previously, the initial drop height must be higher than any of the hills. I chose a initial drop height of 3.50m because at this height the roller coaster gains enough speed to be fun, but doesn't gain to much speed to the point where its not safe. When we simulated this height of 3.50m the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.27 m/s which is right in between the fun and safe point. I chose the first hill height of 3.00m because the hill height has to be less than the initial drop height. When we simulated with a hill height of 3.00m, at the top of the hill the speed was 3.1 m/s. This is enough speed to get over a hill with a lesser height. I would recommend any car mass because car mass doesn't affect the speed of the roller coaster at any time. When we simulated with an initial drop height of 3.50m,  and a car mass of 40 kg, the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.27 m/s. This was the result when the car mass was 50kg, 55kg and 60kg as well. This shows that car mass does not affect the speed at all. \n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "38", "Raw": "43", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 108", "Quality": " 0.3981", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4931", "Comprehensive": "0.4456", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 3(5), 6(4), 10(3), 17(3), 18(3), 23(2), 27(2), 32(2), 35(2), 37(1), 38(1), 42(1), 50(1), 52(1), 61(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 38 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... when the initial drop is higher than the hills or loops\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Our roller coaster has one big initial drop that uses the law of conservation of energy, has hills that are shorter than the previous drop, and has a drop height that makes the speed fast enough for fun but not too fast for safety.\n\n     The higher the drop the more potential energy and kinetic energy that is transferred. For example, for the release height of 5 the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was 2443 and the kinetic energy was 0. At the bottom of the drop the potential energy was 1 and the kinetic energy was 2442. For the release height of 2 the potential energy at the top was 977 and the kinetic energy at the top was 0. At the bottom the potential energy was 1 and the kinetic energy was 977. The more energy that is transferred the more energy the car has to get over the hills. We also used the Law of Conservation with our design too which says that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can convert from one type of energy to another. \n\n     Our roller coaster also had hills that were shorter than the first initial drop. If the hill is taller or the same as the initial drop then the car won't make it over the hill and there won't be as much kinetic energy. For example, in the adding hills experiment the initial drop height was 5 meters. The trial with the hill height being 5 meters showed that the car did not make it to the end of the ride, but the trial with the hill height being 2, 3, or 4 meters after the initial drop did make it to the end of the ride. The mass of the car affects the PE, KE, and total energy. For example, for the experiment we tried the car mass of 40 and it had 1958 PE at the top of the initial drop, 1953 KE at the bottom of the drop, and 1958 total energy. For the car mass 60 it had 2937 PE at the top, 2930 KE at the bottom, and 2937 total energy. This proves that the heavier the car the more PE, KE, and total energy. \n\n     The speed has to be lower than 8.4 m/s but higher than 6.7 m/s. The drop height of the hill had to be lowered so the speed of the car on the coaster was safe because when the height was 4 the speed was 8.33 m/s which was too fast. When the initial drop height was 3.5 the speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.37 m/s which was good because it was inside the parameters. The mass of the car doesn't affect the speed of the car. For example when the mass of the car was 40 kg the speed at the bottom for the drop was 8.27 m/s. When the mass was 60 the speed at the bottom was also 8.27 m/s so it doesn't matter what mass the car is. The more mass the car has the more PE and KE it has.\n\n     With the factors of the initial drop being tall to give it lots of energy, and the hills being shorter than its previous hill and the speed being in the range of being safe but fun, it confirms that the car will make it to the end of the ride and will be safe. Also with having many hills and an initial drop just like the Gonzales family wanted it ensures that the ride will be fun and just what they want.

The higher the initial drop, the more potential energy and more kinetic energy the car will have. Potential energy is the energy that will be transferred to kinetic energy. The car starts with potential energy and ends with kinetic energy. As the car goes down the drop, the potential energy gets transferred to kinetic energy. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but energy can transfer. So however much potential energy there is at the top, there will be the same amount at the bottom of the hill. The potential energy transferred into kinetic energy which follows the conservation law because no energy was created or destroyed it just transferred. Mass also plays a role in energy. The more mass a car has, the more potential energy it will have. For example a car with a mass of 53kg had 2448 Joules of total energy. However a car with a mass of 60kg had 2934 Joules of total energy. This shows that the more mass a car has, the more energy it will have. The initial drop height affects the speed of the car greatly. The higher the drop height, the faster the car will go. An example of this is during my investigation, I found that a drop height of 5 meters had a speed of 9.85 m/s whereas a drop with a height of 4 meters had a speed of 8.84 m/s. This shows that the higher the drop is, the faster the car will go. A safe speed to go at is 8.4 m/s and the drop height that would best come close to this is a height of 3.5 meters and the speed for that is 8.27 m/s. The mass of the car doesn't affect the speed at all. It doesn't matter if you have a car with a mass of 40kg or a car with a mass of 60kg the speed will always remain the same. The speed will always be 8.27 m/s no matter the car mass. I found this in my investigations where I tested cars with masses of 40-60kg and I found that the speed is always 8.27 m/s.

My current roller coaster design is going great.  I have actually decided to start my roller coaster on an initial drop height of 5 meters, then going over a couple hills of only one meter. I guarantee thanks to the Kinetic and Potential Energy, that it won't stop. Since the initial drop is 5 times greater than each of the hills. I have also learned that the greater the mass of the car is, the faster the car will go, so my car will be greater in mass so we can go farther in on the roller coaster so we get to the loops. I also saw that we have more Jewels of Total energy with greater heights, so that should help with our first 5 meter drop.\n     Second off, I would just like to say, my data has also shown me other things. I have also noticed the less mass and height of the initial drop, the slower the car will go. Not to mention that the higher the mass, the more Jewels of potential energy there is. All the energy is there and thanks to the Laws of the Conservation of energy there will be no extra or added energy.\n     Next, I've also learned how the higher the height of the initial drop, the faster the speed will be. Of course, if you are also worried about mass affecting the speed even more, don't even doubt yourself, mass does not affect the speed. I am positive your fans will enjoy a safe and fun ride of a lifetime. Even in my trials for Mass and Speed, I saw that no matter what the mass of the car was, 40, 50, 60,  the speed of the car did not change one bit. Luckily, another interesting fact I learned was that even though we have to restrain the speed, we don't have to restrain the fun.\n     Lastly, I guess we should also talk about how speed will work. We can't have too fast of speed or else or riders will be unsafe and will, well, kick the bucket. Now, like you guys, I don't want the guests and enjoyers unhappy. I saw that at 5 meters the speed at the end of the ride, would have actually killed our little friends riding our coaster. 4.50 meters was better.

Our roller coaster would make it to the end because even though it is the longest roller coaster in the world the hill would just have to be lower than the hill before it. For example in my data I did a drop height of 5 and a hill height of 5 and the car did not make it over the hill because the car did not have enough KE to get over it. so in order for the car to go over a hill it has to be shorter than the one before it otherwise it will not have enough KE to get over it. So if the initial drop is higher than the hill it will have a lot more PE and KE because of how high it is and how high the hill is. Another reason why the car would not make it over the hill is because the PE would not be able to change to KE fast enough to get over a hill taller than the initial drop (energy can not be destroyed or created but can change from one to another). Although if the car mass is higher the more KE that it will have and will also have enough energy to get over a taller hill than your initial drop. Therefore all we would have to do for our roller coaster work is to have some hills that are shorter than the one before it and also have our car mass higher than usual. \nOur roller coaster will make it to the end because the higher that the initial drop is the higher the speed will be. My data proves that this is correct because when I had an initial drop height of 5 the speed ended up being 9.88 at the end of the ride but when I did a drop height of 3.5 the total speed ended up being 8.27 at the end of the ride. Also our mass of our roller coaster car will stay the same at 50kg because no matter the mass of the car it will not affect the speed of the car and it will always stay the same. According to my data when the car mass was 40kg and the speed was 8.27 and when the car mass was set to 60kg the speed was the exact same as when the car was set to 40kg at 8.27. So no matter how much the roller coaster car weighs the speed will always stay the same and this is how my roller coaster will be safe and fun.

This family's coaster needs to be exiting, safe, and agree with gravity! This coaster should have the correct balance of energy (kinetic energy & potential energy) throughout the ride. Lets start with the initial drop. Kinetic energy (KE) during the initial drop should be at 0 and Potential energy (PE) will be whatever the full amount of energy is. Once the coaster starts moving the energy from PE will soon transfer to KE slowly. Now that the coaster is officially moving to transfer into your hill the initial drop MUST be higher than the hill. If you don't adjust the heights for the initial drop to be higher than the hill you will not have a successful coaster. If and when the initial drop is shorter than the hill the coaster will not make it over the hill. Now to do with the space between the initial drop and hill friction will help a lot between these spaces. While it is traveling from this space if you have 0 friction and the coaster doesn't make it over the hill it will just continue to swing back and forth between this space and not stop. But, if you have friction it will help with a slow stop on the coaster because when it swings back and forth after it didn't get over the hill it will eventually stop. For the mass of the coaster it if you decrease or increase the mass it will not affect the speed whatsoever. The more mass the car has, the highest PE it has at the top of an initial drop. For example, the car that was 52 kilograms only had 1270 joules of PE at the top of the initial drop, while the car that was 58 kilograms had 1417 joules of PE at the top. As for the KE at the bottom of the drop it will also increase as the mass of the car increases. Other than those very important details your coaster will be as safe, fun, exciting, and successful as you need it to be. i wish great success to the Gonzales family.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "27", "Raw": "28", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 88", "Quality": " 0.3182", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3211", "Comprehensive": "0.3196", "Content Unit": "0(5), 3(5), 6(4), 7(4), 19(3), 28(2), 35(2), 50(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 0 [Weight: 5]\n\tSegment: ....................

The KE at the bottom of the initial drop will also increase depending on the initial drop height. For example, my first trial had an initial drop height of 5 meters. The PE at the top was 2443 J, the KE at the bottom was 2442. In contrast, my last trial had an initial drop height of 2 meters. The PE at the top was 277 J, the KE at the bottom was 276 J. \n\nThe initial drop height must be taller than the first hill. On my first trial, the initial drop height was 5 meters and the hill height was 2 meters. The PE at the top of the initial drop was 2445 J, and the PE at the top of the hill was 982 J. That energy was transferred into the opposite. The car on the first trial did make it over the hill. This is because the energy was able to successfully transfer. On my last trial, however, the initial drop height and hill height were both 5 meters. The PE at the top of the initial drop was 2449 J. The PE at the top of the hill was 0 J as well as the KE at the top of the hill. This is because the energy continued to be transferred without friction, meaning the ride would not stop because the car didn't make it over the hill. This is because the hill and initial drop height were the same. \n\nThis is due to the Law of Conservation of Energy, which states energy cannot be stopped, but can transfer from one kind to another. \n\nCar mass also effects the PE, KE, and total energy of a roller coaster. When the car mass was 52 kg, the PE at the top of the initial drop was 1270 J. The KE was also 1270 J. The total energy was also 1270 J. When the car mass changed to 58 kg, the PE at the top of the initial drop was 1417, the KE was 1416 J, and the total energy was 1417. This proves that when the car mass increases, so does the PE, KE, and total energy. \n\nThe PE at the top and KE at the bottom are very closely related. The PE at the top transfers and becomes the KE at the bottom. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. \n\nWhile all of this is important, another important piece of information is the mass and speed relationship. When the mass of the car is changed, the speed at the bottom of the hill stays the same no matter what. It all depends on the height of the initial drop. As you increase or decrease the mass of the car, the speed stays the same. For example, my first trial had a mass of 40 kg, and a speed of 8.27 m/s. On my final trial, the mass was 55 kg, and all the other data stayed the same. \n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "41", "Raw": "56", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 111", "Quality": " 0.5045", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6422", "Comprehensive": "0.5734", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 27(2), 32(2), 33(2), 34(2), 37(1), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 50(1), 53(1), 56(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The science behind this coaster is that the initial drop is tall enough that the car will have much potential energy at the top leading to faster speed going down, and the hill will be just short enough for the car to make it over and get to the end of the ride without stopping. But the hill will be tall enough that the car can make it over and the hill will be tall enough for the ride to be exciting, because the potential energy at the top of the hill will be a great amount. I also know the science works because when I tested the hill and initial drop heights, there was enough kinetic energy for the car to make it over both and still be fun. When I tested other hill heights and initial drop heights, the car does not go as fast, and for example an initial drop height of 4 and hill height of 3.5 and a car mass of 60, would have a kinetic energy of 2344, while the 5 high drop and 4.5 high hill with 60 mass car would have kinetic energy of 2929. Also a 60 mass car would have kinetic energy of 2929 at the bottom of the hill and potential energy of 2937 at top of initial drop, while a 50 mass car would have kinetic energy of 2442 at the bottom of the hill and potential energy of 2448 at top of initial drop. I also know that a 5 high initial drop would increase kinetic energy at the bottom and decrease potential energy at the bottom. I know that potential energy will be more if less kinetic energy, and also the other way around. There will be changes in the potential energy at bottom of hill because of more kinetic energy. The bigger the initial drop the more potential energy at the top, same for the top of the hill. More kinetic energy when the car is in motion. The mass will increase the kinetic energy and have no effect on the potential energy. Height affects the potential and kinetic energy because the higher the initial drop the more potential energy at the top and less kinetic energy. When a car goes down the hill, the more kinetic and less potential energy. That is the Law of Conservation of Energy. Mass effects potential because the car is heavier, and affects kinetic energy because it goes faster when going down drops. This proves that not only does the 60 mass car make things more thrilling, but will also get to the end and be scientifically safe.The car mass of 60 would also work because the car is heavy, meaning that it will go fast and go over the drops. After going over some more of the science behind the drop height and speed, and how the mass has to do with the speed, and how the mass has to do with the drop height, I now know that an initial drop height of 5 and a hill height of 4.5 would still work, but the mass of 60 kilograms for the car would need to be changed. I now would keep everything the same, but change the car mass to 50 kilograms. I believe this change is a good thing because after going over the science, I now know that the mass of the car does not increase or decrease the speed. I know this because using the data from my trials I found that a car with a mass of 40 kilograms has speed at the bottom of the initial drop of 8.27 (m/s), speed at the top of the hill of 3.10 (m/s), and speed at the end of the ride of 8.27 (m/s). And I found the same for a car with a mass of 60. The car that mass had speed at the bottom of the initial drop of 8.27 (m/s), speed at the top of the hill of 3.10 (m/s), and speed at the end of the ride of 8.27 (m/s). This not only proves that the mass of the car does not affect the speed, but that speed at the bottom of the initial drop and speed at the end of the ride are the same. I decided the height of 5 for the initial drop and 4.5 for the hill and 50 kg for the car because 5 and 4.5 will allow the car to make it to the end and have a lot of thrill, while being fun and safe. And from the data from my trials which can be seen above, no matter what the mass is, it will go the same speed. I found the same numbers as above as I did for a mass of 50 and 56 kg. So I choose 50 kg because it will not be too heavy for the track, and still be fun. Height impacts potential energy because the higher the drop, the more potential and less kinetic energy at the top. And height impacts kinetic energy because at the bottom of a taller drop, there will be more kinetic energy rather than potential energy. Mass does not impact kinetic or potential energy, and height and mass impacts total energy because the higher the drop, if no hill, the more total energy. And mass does not affect the total energy. Height affects the speed of the car because the higher the initial drop or hill, the more speed the car has. Mass does not affect the speed as proven above. The relationship between potential energy, kinetic energy, and total energy is that if you start at the top of an initial drop, then there is more potential than kinetic energy and total energy is not there yet. At the bottom of the initial drop and at the end of the ride, there will be way more kinetic energy than potential energy, and more total energy. And at the top of a hill there will be both potential and kinetic energy, and total energy will always be the sum of the two. These three variables affect the ride because the higher the drop the more potential and kinetic and total energy there will be, resulting in a faster, and possibly safe ride. The Law of Conservation of Energy affected my design decisions because I wanted the ride to be fast and fun but also safe. I knew that I would need the car to make it over the hill, so that means if I want to have the hill thrilling, it has to be as tall as possible while being safe and fun. So I made the hill shorter by a little so it was safe, and made the initial drop fun and safe because I knew that I needed the car to make it over the hill and have enough energy conserved to get to the end. That is the Law of Conservation of Energy.

In my data when the initial drop height was 5m with a hill height of 5.1m the car didnt make it over the hill but when I kept the initial drop height the same and made the hill height 4.75m the car made it over.\n\nAt the top of the initial drop that is when there is the most PE and no KE when the car goes to end of the roller coaster that is when there is the more KE and the least amount of PE. In the study at the top of the initial drop the PE is 1717 J of PE and KE is 0 J of KE, but when the car makes it to the end the PE is 1 J of PE and the KE is 1716 J of KE. This proves that there is more PE at the top and more KE at the bottom. Also the higher the initial drop height is the higher the PE will be at the top and the higher the KE will be at the bottom. When the initial drop height was 2m the PE at the top of the drop was 977 J of PE and at the bottom the KE was 977 J of KE, but when the initial drop height was higher such as 5m the PE at the top was 2443 J of PE and the KE was 2442 J of KE at the bottom. \n\nAs the car rolls down the initial drop and hills the PE and KE switch, as in when it goes down hill the PE gets less and the KE gets more. The KE builds up because the object is in motion so that creates more KE, as when the car is sitting still there is no KE because there is no movement. When the car is at the top of the initial drop there is a lot of PE because the object is not moving. \n\nThe total energy at the end of the roller coaster is the same as the PE at the beginning. In my data when the PE was 1382 at the start of the initial drop the total energy was 1382 at the end of the roller coaster.\n\n\nThe heavier the car the more PE, KE, and total energy there will be. The data from the simulation showed that when the cars mass was 40 kg there was 1958 PE, KE, and total energy. But when the cars mass was 60 kg the PE, KE, and total energy was 2937.\n\nWhen the PE changes into KE while the car is in motion that is part of the conservation of energy. The Conservation of energy is that energy can not be created or destroyed but it can be transformed between different types of energy. \n\nThe mass of the car does not affect anything about the roller coaster ride. The mass dosnt make the ride go any faster or slower. \n\nThe best height for the initial drop is 3.5m with a hill height of 3m. This is the best because it is the safest for the car to go and it is also still at a fun speed and the car can make it to the end of the ride. When the initial drop height was 5m the speed was 9.89 m/s which is a unsafe speed, but when the initial drop height was 3.5 the speed was 8.27 m/s which is both safe and fun.

That means the Potential energy needs to be high enough at the top so that it can transfer into Kinetic energy at the bottom to get up the hill. The taller the drop the more kinetic energy there will be. No matter how tall the drop is the hill and the loops have to be shorter than the drop no matter what. When I set the Release height to 5 Meters, the car had 2443 joules of Potential Energy. The Kinetic Energy was 2442 joules at the bottom of the drop. The hill height was 4 meters high.\n\n\nThe hill height needs to be shorter than the initial drop no matter what. The car made it to the end of the track when the drop height was 5 meters and the hill height was 4.75 meters. When the hill height was 5 and the drop height was 5 the car did not make it up the hill and it fell back down. When the hill height was 2 and the drop height was 5 it made it up and over the hill and to the end. This shows that the hill height has to be shorter than the drop height no matter what. The potential energy will also be higher when the drop is taller, which then transfers to kinetic energy when it hits the bottom of the drop. \n\n\nThe car mass needs to be at least 50 kg because the car needs to have enough kinetic energy to make it up the hills and loops. My data table shows that 50 kg is the best weight for the car. It doesn't matter how much the car ways because it will always fall at the same speed at any weight. \n\n\nI can give you some recommendations for what height and speed your new rollercoaster should be. I think that the best height for the initial drop would have to be 3.5 meters tall and the hill height would be 3.25 meters. Also, the best weight for the car is 50 Kg because it affects PE and KE the best. It has just enough potential energy \n\n\nThose are my recommendations and some facts for your new roller coaster. I know this will attract a lot more new riders to your park.\n\n\nThank you, Charlie \n\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "36", "Raw": "48", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 106", "Quality": " 0.4528", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5505", "Comprehensive": "0.5016", "Content Unit": "3(5), 6(4), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 15(3), 16(3), 18(3), 27(2), 32(2), 33(2), 35(2), 39(1), 40(1), 42(1), 47(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 35 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... so that the car gets enough speed to get up all the hills and\n\t         .................... loops\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 7 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: .................... so that it can transfer into Kinetic energy at the bottom to get\n\t         .................... up the hill\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 60 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The best drop height of the initial drop is 4 meters because then you can get the most out of the other hills and the ride can provide a more scary experience. Also, we want the ride to be safe and fun at the same time, if the speed is 8.4m/s then the ride will be unsafe. Also, a mass for the car can be anything because when it goes down the hill because mass and speed don't have a relationship. But when the height is higher then the speed will go at 9.8 m/s and keep going at the same rate the whole time. \n\n             As well as that all hills need to be shorter than the initial drop height because according to the conservation of energy when the car goes up the hill and is at the top, That stored PE (stored energy)will turn into KE (active energy) and when it then goes down the hill the PE turns into KE which it uses to get up the next hill and while that is happening, on its way up the hill the KE will turn back into PE because when it goes up the hill it will need to turn that stored energy back into energy that is released when it goes back down again. If there is friction, then some of that energy might go away, and it doesn't break the law of conservation of energy because that energy does not go disappear it just turns into heat energy. when there is no friction, then like we see in the simulations no energy will be turned into heat energy and the total energy will be the same as the PE that you started with.\n\n              If a hill uses up too much KE that exceeds the amount that the car had, then the car will not make it up the hill. Also, where there is the most PE is at the top of the hill and where there is more height, then there is more PE stored and when there is more height then sense there is more PE there will be more KE and that equals total energy. And where there is the most KE is at the bottom of the hill. Also, when there's more mass there will be more KE because the PE that is stored turns to KE then sense the mass was bigger and the there was more PE then there will be more KE.\n                \n              Also, something else that I found was that PE and total energy will be the same as the amount of PE the car has at the top of the initial drop, but only if there is no friction. The same will happen with KE, if there is no friction, then the KE will be the same as the amount of KE the car has at the bottom of the initial drop. Something else I found was that there is a direct relationship between mass and PE as shown in my data because when the mass is 40 then the PE at the top is 1955 J and when the mass Is 55, then the PE at the top of the initial drop 2687J. Also, the same thing happened with KE, mass and KE have a direct relationship, which means when one goes up, then the other goes up, and when one goes down, the same happens to the other as shown in my data here when the mass is 40 then the KE at the bottom of the drop is 1954J and when the mass is 55 then the KE at the bottom of the drop will 2686. \n\n             We can see how the law of conservation of energy affects our roller coaster because as I mentioned before when the roller coaster goes down the hill the PE turns to KE and if there is friction, most of the PE will turn to KE but some of it will also turn into thermal energy.

First, we have to think about PE (potential energy) and KE (kinetic energy). They share a relationship called a direct relationship. That means if the PE of the rollercoaster goes up so does the KE (another way around). There is something a little like a sequence that which the two PE and KE work. At the top, it is 100% PE because it is all the stored up energy and none of it is being used yet, then while the rollercoaster goes down it changes the PE into KE because it starts to use up the energy. Our simulation shows that at the top the PE was equivalent to the TE making it 100% when the car started to go down the PE shifted into KE making the PE 0% when it hits the bottom and KE 100% at the bottom. Here are the stats, Hill height= 2, PE at TOP=2443, TE=2443, KE at TOP=0. When it is at the bottom it has used up all of the stored energy and now it is all KE. There is always a total amount of energy that something has. When something is 100% PE or KE then it is all of the total energy. The energy never goes over the total energy, they can add up and be split but never over the amount. Both PE and KE have formulas to tell us how much we are using. PE is Mass x Gravity (9.8) x Height. KE is 1/2 Mass x Velocity ^2 (squared). So when the height is bigger then means both PE and KE will be bigger since they are both included in their formulas. In other words, it means that when the height goes up so do PE and KE meaning they are a direct relationship. This also applies to mass because both are included in the formulas and both increase the PE and KE meaning they share a direct relationship so when the mass goes up so do PE and KE.\n\n  These factors play into the relationship with heights of initial drop and hills. The Initial drop height has a lot to do with the rollercoaster's total energy because that is what fuels the ride to get it all the way to the end. The Initial drop height needs to be more than a hill because the amount of energy you get from the initial drop isn't enough to go back over a big hill. In our simulations, we put friction to 0 but in real life, friction applies to everything. Here was also some data from the initial drop and hills. When the initial drop height was 5m the only hill heights that worked were 2, 3,4. When we had the initial drop was 5m and so was the hill the car did not pass over the hill. This shows when the hill is the same or bigger the car will not pass over the hill. When friction is pulling back it changes some of the PE and KE to Thermal energy, this also affects how far the cart will go. (Total energy). This also has to do with the Law of Conservation of Energy because although we can't calculate thermal energy it is there and that is where the PE and KE go. Due to friction. This impacts the PE and KE by making them less.\n \n  You also have to think about the cart that has to get through the roller coaster. If we want the rollercoaster to reach the full amount of speed/energy then we want to add more mass. This affects PE and KE because if we look back at the formulas (PE= MGH and KE= 1/2M x V^2) only PE includes Height but in KE it has Velocity (V) and the longer it falls the more velocity it gains making both equations bigger resulting in more energy. Height and speed have a direct relationship so when height goes up to let's say a very tall building and you crop a ball off of it there is more time to have the ball drop meaning that it gets more time to speed up.\n\n So for your rollercoaster, I suggest an Initial drop height of 3.5m to get the most amount possible for TE without going over 8.4, a hill that is 2m (to make it big do it gets over but still exciting), and a mass of 60kg (MAX) because with more mass the more PE and KE the rollercoaster can have meaning it can be a fast, safe, and fun ride. We also need to be aware of the speed so we can be safe. We need it to be over 6.7m/s so it can be fun but it can't be over 8.4m/s else it won't be safe.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "64", "Raw": "47", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.3534", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5390", "Comprehensive": "0.4462", "Content Unit": "3(5), 4(4), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 20(2), 21(2), 27(2), 28(2), 29(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 37(1), 42(1), 44(1), 47(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 59 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... we need to make sure that it will work properly and still be a fun\n\t         .................... ride.\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 51 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The height gave the car more speed at the beginning and towards the end, but they were the same. For example, when I made the initial drop height 5m high the speed was 9.84, but when I made the initial drop height 2.25, the speed was 6.63. Height and speed are directly related. Mass doesn't affect speed a whole lot, I'll show you why. For example when I made the car mass 60kg, the speed was 9.88, when I made the car mass 40kg, the speed was 9.88. Speed does not change because of mass.\n\nHeight and Mass affect PE(potential energy AKA the stored energy) and KE(kinetic energy AKA the energy being used) because both are directly related to PE and KE, meaning if one goes up the other does too, because the more height and mass there is more PE to be turned into KE and TE. Until you bring up friction, and this is where I mention thermal energy and the Law of Conservation of energy(stating that energy can't be created nor destroyed) so the PE that turns into KE going down the initial drop, then friction kicks in then starts turning some of the KE, into thermal energy, further stating that energy can't be created nor destroyed. I can also say this because the total energy stays the same as the beginning. \n\nHope this helps, Braydon ", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "24", "Raw": "30", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 82", "Quality": " 0.3659", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3440", "Comprehensive": "0.3549", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 10(3), 19(3), 27(2), 28(2), 35(2), 36(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... the first hill should be shorter than your initial drop, but we\n\t         .................... know that.\n\t", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 2": "Content Unit: 35 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... when something rolls down a hill but then\n\t", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 3": "Content Unit: 3 [Weight: 5]\n\tSegment: .................... when something but then comes up on a bigger hill\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 27 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

Potential energy is the energy stored in an object and is at its most at the top of the initial drop. Kinetic energy is the energy an object has when it is in motion, and it is at its most at the bottom of a drop when the car is parallel to the ground.  As the car ascends a hill, kinetic energy is converted into potential energy, and when it goes down the hill, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The abbreviations KE and PE will be used in this essay.\n      To have the most potential energy, the maximum possible drop height is needed.  In this scenario, the highest is 5 meters, so we will go with that for the time being. The formula for potential energy is PE=mgh. Because height is in the formula, when you use a larger drop height the potential energy at the top of the drop will increase. The same is true for the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop. Kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop is always the same as the potential energy at the top because as the car goes downhill the PE converts into KE. The law of conservation of energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed, and that is exactly what happens as the cart goes down the track.  KE and PE are both directly related to height, and this can be proven by the data from my trials. When I used an initial drop height of 2, the potential energy at the top was 977 J and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 977 J. When the height was increased to 5 m, the PE at the top increased to 2443 J and the KE at the end to 2443 J as well. If all we wanted was the most potential energy possible, 5 meters would be the best height for the drop.\n        However, the ride also has to be safe. For this to happen, the speed cannot exceed 8.4 m/s, and speed and height are directly related. This means that as we increase the height, the speed will also increase. So, the height has to be low enough that the maximum speed is less than 8.4 m/s. In my trials, Iâve found that the ideal height is 3.6 meters, which results in a maximum speed of 8.39, just slightly below the upper limit for a safe ride. \n         At any point in the ride, KE + PE equals the total energy. Experimenting with adding hills, I found that at the top of a hill, there are different amounts of PE and KE but added together they always equal the total energy. In one trial, the KE was 10 J and the PE was 1704 J. 10 + 704 = 1714 J, which was the total energy. In those trials, I also found that for the car to make it to the end of the ride, the height of the hill had to be less than the initial drop height. I used an initial drop height of 3.5 for my trials, and of 4 different heights only the ones that were less than 3.5 allowed the car to get to the end of the track. This is because the initial drop determines the total energy for the ride, and the law of conservation of energy dictates that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, so if a hill requires more energy to get over than the total energy, the car cannot get over it. Because of this, the best height for the hill in our ride is just slightly less than 3.6 meters, so I chose 3.59 m.\n      The mass of the car also plays a role in the potential and kinetic energy in the ride. The formula for PE, as stated earlier, is PE=mgh. Mass and PE are directly related, meaning that as mass increases so will the PE. The same is true for KE, with the formula KE=1/2 m x v^2. In practice, this is all a lot of words to say that the greater the car mass, the more kinetic energy, potential energy, and therefore total energy the ride will have. For example, the trial with a car mass of 40 had a total of 1955 J of energy, and the trial with a car mass of 60 had 2932 J. No other variables were changed, and the difference in energy is quite clear.\n       However, ultimately, the goal is for the ride to be fun, meaning it has to be fast, and having a greater or smaller mass will do nothing to the speed. Mass and speed are completely unrelated, and so when mass changes, it does nothing to the speed. This means that the mass can be anything within the limits of what the structures can withstand. \n       In conclusion, the ideal measurements for the ride (assuming it is somehow in a frictionless environment) are this: 3.6 m drop height, 3.59 m hill height, and any reasonable car mass.\n\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "67", "Raw": "72", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.5414", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.8257", "Comprehensive": "0.6835", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 20(2), 24(2), 27(2), 28(2), 32(2), 35(2), 37(1), 42(1), 46(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The higher the drop height is the more potential energy you will have. The same goes for a lower drop height. The lower your drop height is the lower the amount of potential energy you will have. \n\n          The amount of potential energy is very important to your ride, Potential energy and kinetic energy have an inverse relationship meaning, that as one goes up the other goes down and vice versa. Because of this, the starting amount of potential energy you have is what will be converted into different types of energy such as heat energy, and kinetic energy. This is all dependent on friction. If there is friction on your ride the potential energy will get converted to Kinetic energy AND Heat energy. However, if there is no friction the Potential energy will get converted to Kinetic energy, but not heat energy. In your case, there is friction so the potential energy will get converted to both Heat energy and Kinetic energy. As a result, the starting amount of potential energy will not be equal to your kinetic energy. \n          This is important for you to know because The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. For your roller coaster, this means that the amount of energy you start with at your initial drop is all you will have for the rest of your ride while it gets converted. Because energy cannot be created, there will never be a point in your ride where there will be more energy than you had at the top of your initial drop. So, when designing the heights for your hills, you should never have a hill height or a loop height be taller than your initial drop. Also, because in your case there will be friction some of the energy will get converted into heat energy. Due to this, your hill heights and your loop heights should also never be the same height as your initial drop. \n         \n          All of this is important because it helps to determine the speed of your ride. The speed of your ride is also exceptionally important to the success of your ride. This is because too fast can make your ride dangerous for the passengers on it. Too fast (8.4 m/s and over) is way too dangerous for the people on the ride. However too slow (lower than 6.7 m/s) can make your ride too boring and not as fun for the people on it. Shoot for somewhere in between. It is also helpful to know that there is no need to worry about the mass of your cart while focusing on everything else in order to make your ride successful. This is because everything on earth falls at 9.8 m/s no matter how heavy something is. As long as your cart stays the same size, it won't matter how many passengers are on it, or how much they all weigh together. \n          Based on my test trials, I found that in order to hold a good speed while the ride remains safe and still fun I recommend a hill height of 3.75. With changing masses and amounts of friction, the cart was able to make it to the end with a max speed of 8.1 m/s with a lower amount of friction. When I added higher amounts of friction the ride did go a little slower, but still at least around 7.5 m/s. \n           \n          In all, I suggest that your hill height is 3.75 at most otherwise based on my trials your ride may become too dangerous. If 8.1 m/s feels too fast, then maybe go a little lower to 3.5 m/s or 3.25 m/s. Overall, I feel that this height is perfect for success.\n\n              \n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "54", "Raw": "52", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 124", "Quality": " 0.4194", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5963", "Comprehensive": "0.5078", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 10(3), 11(3), 13(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 21(2), 22(2), 27(2), 28(2), 35(2), 38(1), 42(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 57(1), 59(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The reason potential energy and the height of the initial drop have significant importance is that they have a direct relationship this means when the height of the initial drop is higher the potential energy of the cart has more potential energy. This also means that the cart will have more kinetic energy when it starts to move because potential energy and kinetic energy have a direct relationship meaning as the potential energy goes up the cart will have more kinetic energy\n              energy can not be created or destroyed because the total amount of energy is constant in the entire universe \n        the amount of PE the ride has completely depends on how high the initial drop height is because height and potential energy have a direct relationship so the amount of PE the ride has the more kinetic energy the ride will have when it starts to move. so it's better to have a higher initial drop height to make sure you get all the way through the ride.\n\n               \n\n\n The height of the initial drop and the height of the hill also has significant importance because the hill must have less height than the initial drop because the kinetic energy will run out by the time the cart reaches the top of the hill and not be able to kid over the hill to gain more kinetic energy.\n\n                  in a frictionless world, the pe at the top of the ride will be the same as the ke at the bottom of the ride.\n\n\n                  the greater\n the height of the drop the more pe it has and the more ke it will have the more mass the car has it will make the  \nThe mass of the car will not effect the amount of velocity or pe/ke.\n\n       the mass of the car has no relation to how much speed the car will have this is because everything falls at 9.8 meters per second and mass does not change the only thing that can change is the amount of friction the object has also the height does not affect the speed because no matter what everything will fall at 9.8 meters per second just like the mass.\n\n            when talking about heat and energy the relationship is because of friction some of the energy may transfer to heat. for example, if a roller coaster went on a track the cart would lose some speed because of friction transferring heat onto the tracks so if you were to touch the tracks after a car went over it you may feel some heat from the tracks onto your hand.\n \n           the law of conservation of energy affects the roller coaster because energy can not be created or destroyed", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "30", "Raw": "38", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 94", "Quality": " 0.4043", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4358", "Comprehensive": "0.4200", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 9(4), 11(3), 13(3), 22(2), 23(2), 35(2), 42(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

It had the PE of 2203 J at the top, and 434 J and the end of KE. The higher the drop is the better (more total energy). \nAt the top of the drop, all the energy is at the PE but when it drops it transfers all to the KE (or it should). But now adding the second hill, it has to be smaller then the drop otherwise it wont get over the hill because it wont have enough energy to. My hill of 2.50 m it had 2200 J at the top of the hill for PE and at the end of the hill it had 1116 J, but my 5.00 m hill it had a PE of 2204 J and a KE of 18 and the end, but it didn't make it over the hill.\nThe energy all stays it just transfers to which type of energy it is. The total energy cant lose any, it cant make any more, it can just transfer. \nThe more the car mass goes the more momentum it has making it go faster. The speed affects the KE, and the more mass the more KE makes the PE have more in the beginning. My car mass of 60 kg on my 5.00 m drop and 2.50 m hill had PE of 1955 J at the top of the hill, but at the bottom had a KE of 1952 J compared to my car of 60 kg on the same track having a PE of 2932 J and a KE at the bottom of 2928 J. So it was faster when the car mass was greater. \nLike I said, the higher the better (more total energy), the more total energy the more PE at the top of the hill cause when its higher the speed will be faster, going fast after the drop the energy will transfer to KE because it is in motion after the initial drop.  \n\nYes the hill of 2.50 and initial drop of 5 m was the fastest but my passengers would be dead due to the speed limit of being 8.4. That hill and drop went 9.88 m/s which is way over the limit. but my hill of 3.50 was a sweet spot of 8.26 m/s it is fast but not too fast. so the initial drop really determines what the speed is. The mass of the car doesn't affect anything speed wise. My first trial I had put down the speed after the initial drop, my cart weighed 40 kg and was 8.29 m/s and my car that weighed 60 m/s was 8.27 m/s.

The hills all have to be smaller than the initial drop though and they have to continue to get smaller throughout the ride. If the hills are the same height or taller than the initial drop the car will not make it to the end. My design includes an initial drop of 5 meters, then a loop that is 4.5 meters tall. Next, there is a 4-meter tall hill and another loop that is 3.5 meters tall. There is one more hill that is 3 meters tall before the coaster levels out. The weight of the car is 60kg. The different-sized loops and hills will make this roller coaster exciting. The heights of the hills and loops gradually get smaller, meaning the car will make it to the end. This also maximizes the amount of energy possible on the roller coaster. In my trials, when I made the hills smaller than the initial drop the car made it to the end. For example, when the initial drop height was 4.5 meters and the hill was 4 meters the amount of energy was 2203, which was higher than when the drop height was 4.5 meters and the hill height was 2.5 meters. The energy was 2199 during that trial. This shows that the higher the hill, as long as it remains shorter than the drop height, the more energy on the roller coaster. The height of the initial drop also helps determine the amount of energy. The higher the initial drop, the more potential energy at the top and kinetic energy at the bottom. The mass of the car would also have to be higher. When I tested a car that weighed 40kg the energy was only 1761, but when I tested a car that weighed 60kg the energy was 2641. This shows that the greater the mass, the more energy on the roller coaster.\n\nI chose these heights because in my trials, the higher the drop or hill, the more energy there was. In my initial drop trials, when the drop was 3 meters the energy was 1466, but when the drop height was 4.5 meters the energy was 2199. When the hills were taller there was more energy as well. I chose the mass of my car because in my trials when the mass was greater, the energy was greater. In my mass and energy trials, when the mass was 40kg the energy was 1761, but when the mass was 60kg the energy was 2641. The height impacts the total energy and therefore impacts the potential energy and kinetic energy as well. The greater the total energy the more potential energy there is at the top of the ride. That potential energy then transfers to kinetic energy throughout the ride. Mass does the same thing. The greater the mass of the car, the more total energy. All of the energy is potential energy at the beginning of the ride. As the ride progresses, that potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. The kinetic energy throughout the ride has to remain above zero, otherwise, the car will stop. The Law of Conservation of Energy tells me that the amount of energy will always remain the same. This is important because the amount of energy you start with is the amount of energy you end with. I wanted my design to have as much kinetic energy as possible to make it fun. This means I have to design my roller coaster to have as much energy as possible. I did this by making the initial drop and hills as tall as possible and the mass as heavy as possible.

How does the height of the initial drop relate to the amount of PE at the top and the KE at the bottom: The higher the initial drop is, the more PE there will be at the top, and the more KE there will be at the bottom. We know that this is true because when I set the initial drop height at 2.00m, the amount of PE was 782J at the top, and at the bottom, there was 782J of KE. When I set the initial drop height at 5.00m, there was 1955J of PE at the top, and 1955J of KE at the bottom.\n\n2.) How does the relationship between PE, KE, and the total amount of energy affect the ride: The total amount of energy will stay the same throughout the whole ride, although it might be covert into different types of energy, it will be destroyed or be created. The total amount of PE at the top of the ride will convert into KE as the car goes down the hill/drop. if there is a hill after the initial drop, the amount of KE will convert back into PE as its goes up the hill, but if there is not enough KE it will not be able to go over the hill. We know that this is true because when I had the initial drop set at 2.50m tall, the total amount of energy stayed the same throughout the whole ride, but the PE from the begging all got converted into KE once the car was down the initial drop. This stayed true throughout all 4 trials.\n\n3.) Changes in PE and KE when the car goes down the hill: The amount of PE and KE was around the same number as the car was at the peak of the hill it was going over. This statement stayed true throughout each trial/experiment that I ran. The amount of PE that the car had at the peak of a hill that was 2.00m tall, was 738J, and the KE was 1173. In another trial that I ran, I found that when a car went over a hill that was 2.50m tall, it had 977 PE and 977 KE.\n\n4.) Energy transformation and the Law of Conservation of Energy: The Law of Conservation of Energy is, Energy can not be destroyed nor created. This means that the amount of total energy an object has will stay the same, and rather than the energy being destroyed or created it will simply just convert into another type of energy. An example of this was when I had set the initial drop height at 5.00m, and the PE ( which was 1955J) got converted all into KE. at the bottom of the drop, the amount of PE was 0J and the amount of KE was 1955J, but the total amount of energy was still the same.\n\n5.) The relationship between initial drop height and hill height: The height of the hill needs to be less than the height of the drop that comes before it. The height of the hill can not be the same as the drop before it, because the car will not make it over. We know that this is true because when I set the height of the hill at 5.02m and the height of the initial drop at 5.00m the car did not go over the hill and did not make it to the end. When I set the height of the hill at  4.00m and had the initial drop at 5.00m, the car made it over the hill and made it to the end of the ride.\n\n6.) The relationship between mass, PE, and KE: The more mass the car has, the more PE it will have at the top of the hill, and the more KE it will have at the bottom of the hill. The less mass the car has, the less PE it will have at the top of the hill, and the less KE it will have at the bottom of the hill. We know that this is true because when I set the mass of the car at 60.00kg it had 2932J of total energy, and the car with 40.00kg of mass only had 1955J of total energy.\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n7.) The mass of the car does not and will never affect the total speed of the coaster. this is because the amount of mass in the PE and KE equation is the same, therefore it can be canceled out of the equation. (it has no effect). We know that this is true because when I set the mass of the car at 60kg, it had the same amount of speed as the car with 40kg of mass at the top of the hill, the bottom of the initial drop, and the end of the ride.\n\n8.) The higher the initial drop is, the more speed the car will have throughout the ride. We know that this is true because when I had set the initial drop height at 5.00 it had 9.88 m/s of speed, but when the drop height was 2.50 it only has 6.99 m/s or speed.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "72", "Raw": "46", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.3459", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5275", "Comprehensive": "0.4367", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 10(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 26(2), 27(2), 29(2), 32(2), 33(2), 35(2), 37(1), 42(1), 46(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The following paper will explain not only how to find the best roller coaster design, but how the science works behind the scenes to make them functional. \n\nNumber one, \"What aspect does the height of the coaster play on the PE at the top and the KE at the bottom\", To  start of the potential energy is effected by the hill height, the higher the hill the more potential energy there will be. This can be shown through the example of the experiment \"Initial Drop\", it can be seen that when the release height was at 5.00 meters the potential energy was at 2697, but when it was at 4.04 meters the potential energy was at 2178. Proving that the higher the hill the higher the Potential energy that will be present, to add on this concept can be applied to kinetic energy, the larger the PE and the larger the hill height are the larger the kinetic energy will be at the bottom of the hill. For example looking again at the experiment \"Initial Drop\" it can noted that when the height of the hill was 5.00 meters the kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill was at its highest point in the experiment of 2696, and when the hill height was at 4.04 the kinetic energy was at 2177. Overall, it proves the idea that the higher the hill the higher the PE will be at the top and the higher the KE will be at the bottom! \n\nNumber two, \"What is the relationship between the PE, KE and total energy\". To take a deeper look into this, it can be shown through the lab known as \"Initial Drop\", in this lab when looking at the number of PE, KE, and total energy they are all in the same ball park. For example: When the hill height was 4.04 meters the PE was 2178 at the top of the hill , the KE was 2177 at the bottom of the hill, the total energy was at 2178. Proving that the numbers are all in the same range, it should be noted that the total PE is always the same as the total energy in the experiment across the board.\n\n\n\nNumber three, \"Changes in PE and KE going down the drop\". This can be clearly shown in the experiment known as \"Add a Hill\" in this virtual simulation it shows how the PE and KE effect the roller coasters ability to concur a hill. This also supports the idea of PE and KE fluctuating throughout the course of the simulation. For example: The PE is at its highest point when it's at the initial drop, as seen in test one, where the total PE was 2446. As the ride reaches the end or a top of a hill the KE levels rise, as shown when the first trial reaches the top of a hill (1095)KE overall. \n\n\nNumber four, \"Energy transformation & Law of energy conservation\" These idea of law of energy conservation states that energy can not be created or destroyed, but more or less converted from one to the other form, the can be seen as the PE transferred to the KE as the ride progresses. Also it proves the idea that energy transformation is done constantly and very fluently  without the average person knowing that its happening in a given place or time! (PE and KE are constantly changing from one to the other during the duration of the  roller coaster ride overall!)\n\n\n\nNumber five, \"Relationship between the drop height and hill height\" This can be proven when once again looking at the \"Add a Hill\" simulation or test. The drop height must always be larger than the hill height in order for the ride to be complete-able. For example: When the hill height was 5.00 meters and the Drop height was 5.00 meters that roller coaster car was not able to complete the course. But when the hill height was 4.75 meters and the drop height was 5.00 meters the roller coaster was able to complete the course or the ride at hand.\n\n\nNumber six, \"The relationship between the mass, PE and KE\" This can be seen through the example under the name of \"Mass & Energy Data\", The overall results point to the idea that the higher the mass of the roller coaster car is the higher the PE and KE are that is present. For example: when the car mass was 60 kg, the PE and the KE were at (2938-2930). When compared to the car mass being 46 kg , the PE and the KE were at (2253-2247). Proving the idea that the higher the mass of the car the higher the PE and KE present are in the roller coaster ride! \n\n\nNumber Seven, Height and Mass: \"How does the height and mass affect the PE and KE and the total energy\"  The height and mass affects the aspect of the PE and KE as well as the total energy. The higher the drop and the higher mass of the given simulation the higher the PE, KE and total energy present are at the given time. This can be shown in the simulation under the name of \"Mass & Energy\", when the mass of the car was 60kg the total PE was 2938, the total KE was 2930 and the total energy was 2938, but when the car mass was 46kg the total PE was 2253 and the total KE was 2247 and the total energy was 2253. For the height aspect, this can be shown in the example of \"Drop height & Speed\", where when the initial drop height was altered in meters and the car mass was at an even 60kg in each trial. During the trial one when the initial Drop height was 5.00 meters the top speeds reached were in the range of (9.87-9.88 m/s), but when the initial drop was at 3.5 meters the top speeds measured in at the range of (8.27-8.28 m/s). Proving that the higher the initial drop and the higher the mass the higher the overall PE and KE, the total energy rate will be present during the duration of the roller coaster ride! \n\nNumber Eight, Height and Mass: \"How does height and mass affect the speed\"\nThe height of the initial drop is the true factor that helps or allows a given object to reach a high rate of speed or  a high rate of velocity. This can be shown in the simulation under the name of \"Mass and Speed Exploration Data\", where the mass of the car was altered between 40kg- 60kg. During the multiple trails the results stayed the same or within one of each other. For example when the mass of the car was 60kg the speed at the bottom was 8.27 m/s, but when the weight went down to 54kg the speed at the bottom stayed at 8.27 m/s. Proving that the mass has no aspect on the speed or velocity, but more that the height played the larger aspect in the given speed of the roller coaster car during the simulations and even throughout the rides. \n\nNumber Nine, \"How Law of Conservation of Energy affects your design\" \nThe law of conservation affects my design in the following ways. Number one being that the energy needs a place to go, meaning that there must be a point where there is a substantial amount of energy shifting from PE and KE and so on and so forth. Number two, that the PE and KE can not produce a speed over the rate of 8.4 m/s, ensuring that the ride it not only same for the rider but still accomplish-able during the duration of the given ride at a certain place and time. \n\nTo conclude, There is a ton of science behind a roller coaster, so next time that you are riding one you can appreciate all the different ideas or aspects that go into the seemingly simple act or ride of a roller coaster. \n \n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "88", "Raw": "61", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.4586", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6995", "Comprehensive": "0.5791", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 10(3), 11(3), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 33(2), 35(2), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 47(1), 48(1), 49(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 62(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 46 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... the hill the more potential energy there will be\n\t", "sentence 5 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 11 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... meters the potential energy was at, but when it was at.\n\t", "sentence 6 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 20 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... meters the potential energy was at.\n\t", "sentence 7 Segment ID: 2": "Content Unit: 48 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

The higher the drop height the more PE there will be at the top, for example in trial 1, of the \"Initial drop\" you have a release height of 2.5m and you have 1217 J of PE, whereas, in trial 2 where you have a release height of 5m you have 2434J of PE,  this PE will then convert into KE at the bottom of the ride. The total amount of energy stays the same throughout the whole ride. To prove this you can look at the data for trial 2 of \"Add a hill\" this shows that you start with 2448J of energy and you end with 2448J of energy. As the car moves down the hill the PE transfers into KE, but the amount of total energy stays the same throughout the ride. If you want to add a hill, the height of that hill needs to be lower than your initial drop height. This ensures that you will have enough energy to make it all the way up and over. The same thing applies if you want to add more hills; the height of those hills needs to be lesser than the height of the previous one. The higher the mass of the roller coaster car the more PE, KE, and total energy you will have. When you have a mass of 60kg you have 2934J of PE whereas if you have a mass of 40kg you only have 1956J of PE at the top of the initial drop.\n\n\n\nI think the ideal roller coaster design would be a roller coaster with an initial drop height of 3.25m and a hill height of 2.5m this ensures a fun AND safe ride. The mass of the roller coaster should be around 50kg because this provides enough energy to get over the hill.  I choose this mass and height because it stayed within the \"safe speed range\" of 6.7-8.4 m/s. I know this because in my trial where I had these heights and mass I went 7.97 m/s. Height impacts PE, KE, and total energy, because the higher the drop height the more PE, KE, and total energy you will have. The higher your initial drop height the faster the speed. Mass impacts PE, KE, and total energy because it causes there to be MORE energy. However mass DOSN'T affect the speed, it stays the same no matter the mass. The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is important because the energy transfer ensures a fast ride, and also makes sure that you can get to the end of the ride.

Our very best design so far includes a 5 m initial drop with a 2 m hill. After performing some experiments we found the 5 m initial drop had the most energy with 2443 J, while the 3 m only had 1466J. That is why we decided to use the 5 m initial drop on our coaster. The 5 m had 2443 J of PE at the top and the bottom had 1442 J of KE at the bottom. Because it's the highest, it has the most energy. The more PE there is affecting the KE which is what pushes the cart forward, this all affects total energy because the more total energy the more KE there will eventually be. When the cart moves down the hill the PE turns into KE which allows the cart to get over the 2 m high hill. Going back to the initial drop this initial drop is needed to get the energy to move to KE, energy cannot be created or destroyed only transferred so having this overall energy be as high as possible will help push the cart to the end and exist the riders. Talking about hill height, it needs to be lower than the initial drop because otherwise, the cart won't make it over or to the end, we recommend 2 m because at the top of the hill the KE was 1468 J which was the highest compared to our other hill heights, for example, the hill height of 3 m was only 1077 J. Height effects PE and KE because the higher the height the more energy. You need this energy because the potential energy is higher at higher drops, which will eventually turn into KE and that is needed to push the cart up and above your hill. Since energy cannot be created or destroyed as the Law of Conservation of energy says, this extra energy is much needed. Now that we have taken the initial drop and hill height into consideration we need to talk about mass. The car's mass is a very important factor, after conducting an experiment on car mass we concluded that the 60 kg car was gonna be the most effective car, seeing as it had the most KE at the bottom of the drop when compared to our other experiments. It had 2934 J of KE, and the 40 kg car only had 1953 J of KE at the bottom, and this is why we chose the 60 kg. Putting it simply, the more mass the more energy there will be. In conclusion, we think it would be most effective for the car to make it to the end having a 5 m initial drop, a 2 m hill, and a 60 kg car. \n\n\n\nFor the roller coaster, we recommend you start with an initial drop height of 3.5 m, have a loop of 3 m, and a hill of 2 m after that. The mass of the car should be 60 kg to get the most energy possible. We tested all those factors and the speed was at a safe but thrilling speed of 8.27 m/s. We chose the mass of 60 kg because it was also at the same speed of 8.27 m/s just as every other car, but it had the most J of energy as we saw in the mass and energy simulation. It had 2934 J of KE, and the 40 kg car only had 1953 J of KE at the bottom of the drop. To maximize energy and get the car to the end, we chose the 60 kg car. Mass doesn't change the speed of the coaster, but height does, that's why we carefully chose 3.5 m, we used to suggest 5 m but with new information, we decided 3.5 would be the safest height. Just like height, the more mass there is the more energy there is. We chose the heaviest car for this reason and the highest safest height for this reason. The more PE or total energy there is at the top of the ride the farther the car will go along and the best chance you have at getting the car to the end. This PE turns into KE along the ride which is what boosts it to the end and will get the car there. The law of conservation of energy affects all of our decisions along the way. It states that energy cannot be destroyed or created, only transferred. Knowing that we can't create energy to push it along we have to figure out how else we can get the most energy possible. We looked at all our trials and decided that 60 kg would be the best having 2930 J of KE at the bottom. And the best height is 3.5m with a speed of 8.27 m/s. From past experiments, we learned that the hill height and loop height had to be smaller than the one before so that's why we chose 3.0m for loop, and 2m for height. \n\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "59", "Raw": "55", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 129", "Quality": " 0.4264", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6307", "Comprehensive": "0.5285", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 10(3), 11(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 27(2), 29(2), 33(2), 34(2), 35(2), 38(1), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 50(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Lets say we have a 5m tall initial drop. The best hill height would be roughly 4.56m. With a 5m drop height, a car that weighs 60kg would have 2935J of PE at the top of the initial drop, and 2920J of KE at the bottom of the drop. A car that weighs 40kg would have 1957J of PE at the top of the drop and 1947J of KE at the bottom of the drop. A greater mass equals more PE to be turned into KE for the car. For the hill height, the height would have to be less than the height of the initial drop, or else the car wont make it over. For example, if the initial drop was 5m and the hill was 5m, the car would have 0KE at the top of the hill, so it would roll backward instead of finishing the ride. This is because as the car goes down the initial drop, the PE is turned into KE, but when the KE is gone, all the car has is PE. Since the car wouldn't have enough KE to get over the hill, the hill has to be smaller than the initial drop, since energy cannot be created. The initial drop height should also be fairly tall, because the higher the drop, the more PE to be turned into KE, because energy cannot be created nor destroyed. For example, a 5m tall initial drop gives the car roughly 2447J of PE that can be turned into KE, vs a 2m tall initial drop gives roughly 976J of PE to be turned in to KE. \n\nOur roller coaster would be the most safe and the most fun, because we have safe yet fast speeds and stuff. We decided on a 3.5m initial drop height, because it allows a fun speed without going over the limit of 8.4m/s. With our drop height of 3.5m, and we chose 50kg for the mass of the car, because the mass of the car doesn't matter. The speed at the bottom of the initial drop will always be 8.27m/s in a friction-less world, and at the top of the first hill, which is 2.5m tall, the car would have a speed of 4.5m/s. At the end of the ride the car would have a speed of 8.27m/s, because the law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, so the total energy would be the same. Because energy cannot be destroyed, we cannot create a ride that is too fast, or else the passengers could die, and that wouldn't be good. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like almost no one would want to go on a roller coaster that makes you sign a waiver saying \"possible chance of injury or death\" But anyways the amount of PE that you start with at the top of the ride is basically the total amount of energy, because PE turns into KE and energy cant be created or destroyed. The PE at the top of the hill gets converted to KE at the bottom.

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "6278bd4c14d3319042ba6972", "class_id": "3", "teacher_id": "JP", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "I would recommend the height of the roller coaster be 5.00m off the ground when making their roller coaster. The height of the roller coaster affects the potential energy in the roller coaster because its energy can be transferred to kinetic energy. KE is transferred from PE when the potential for energy decreases as you go down the roller coaster. Height relates to PE at the top because the height affects how much energy could potentially be used, and kinetic energy at the bottom because this PE is transferred and the potential for the energy goes down. Height affects the amount of potential energy as showed in my data when the roller coaster was dropped from 5.00m, and the potential energy was calculated up to 2443J, and when another roller coaster was dropped from a lower height such as 2.00m, the potential energy was only calculated to 2077J. That's a 366J difference!\n\nThe relationship between PE and KE relates to each other after and before the roller coaster starts. This brings in total energy when the law of conservation states that energy can't be created nor destroyed. Total energy tells us that while the roller coaster runs, the PE is transferring and not being created then destroyed then created again after going down this roller coaster. This shows in my data when in the data for the initial drop, it visualizes that the PE and KE never go above the total number of energy. In trial 1, it shows us that the PE at the top of the Initial drop is 2443J, the KE at the bottom of the drop is 2442J, and the total energy is 2443J. \n\nKE is transferred from PE when the potential for energy decreases as you go down the roller coaster. The change between PE and KE from the top to the bottom of the coaster when the energy is transferred to KE as the potential for energy goes down. This shows in my data in the initial drop trial one when it visualizes for us that the PE at the top of the initial drop is 2443J, and then the energy transfers to KE at the bottom of the drop when the energy is stood at 2442J. \n\nThe total energy limit for the roller coaster is the PE that's calculated before the ride starts because the Conservation of Energy states that energy is never created or destroyed. This suggests that when the roller coaster meets the top or near the top of the hill after the initial drop, it'll fall back down because there won't be enough total and PE to make it over again. This shows in the data I collected in trial two when I dropped the roller coaster at 5.00m and made the hill height to 5.00m, there was only 2446J PE, and didn't make it over the hill. This shows that the more PE and higher the initial drop, the better the chance that the roller coaster will make it over the hill without falling back down.\n\nMass affects potential energy by collecting more total energy used by the roller coaster cart.  A heavier mass of the cart results in higher potential energy, making the speed and KE larger than if you were to use a cart with a smaller mass. This is shown in my data when comparing my first and second trials. My first trial shows that the cart mass is 60kg and results in 2935J of potential energy compared to my second trial with 40kg mass of the car, resulting in only 1956J of energy in the roller coaster ride. This is a 979J difference between the car mass for each roller coaster ride. \n\nThe relationship between mass and KE is almost the same as mass and PE. When there's more total energy caused by more mass in a cart, that energy always almost fully transfers to KE. Resulting in a larger KE than compared to a cart with a smaller mass. This shows in my data in trial one when the car mass was set to 60kg, and the KE at the end of the drop is 2926J. While a cart with a smaller mass such as my second trial, 40kg, results in only 1951J at the end of the ride.  This is a 975J difference between the car mass for each roller coaster ride. \n\nMass affects PE by creating more potential for energy to be transferred to KE. This affects KE because the more potential for energy creates the more transferring between PE to KE as the roller coaster goes down and back up hills. \n\nThe relationship between the initial drop height and the speed of the car can severely affect each other. I know this because the more PE set into something is going to affect the outcome after the PE transfers to KE. This shows in my data when the initial drop starts at 5.00m, and the speed of the car at the end of the ride is 9.88m/s compared to when the initial drop starts at 3.32m, and the speed at the end of the ride is only 8.05m/s. Initial drop height affects the speed of the car. \n\nA higher car mass and the speed is the same as a lower car mass and speed because my data shows when I have a car mass of 60kg and measure the speed at the end of the ride which was 9.88m/s, it will be the same as when I set the car mass at 40kg when the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88m/s. This shows that the mass of any car doesn't affect the speed of the roller coaster. The mass cancels each other out on each side of the equation. Essentially what we are really solving is the velocity, and affecting the velocity. The gravity always stays the same, so that hasn't any effect either. 2(gravity*height)=velocity^2\n\nMass doesn't directly make the roller coaster unsafe, but it indirectly does. \n\nMy final recommendation to the Gonzales family about the best roller coaster design is an initial drop of 5.00m, a hill of 4.64m, and the mass of the cart 50kg. I decided on the height of 5.00m for my initial drop height because the height of the roller coaster affects the potential energy in the roller coaster because its energy can be transferred to kinetic energy. Height affects the amount of potential energy as showed in my data when the roller coaster was dropped from 5.00m, and the potential energy was calculated up to 2443J, and when another roller coaster was dropped from a lower height such as 2.00m, the potential energy was only calculated to 2077J. I recommended a height of 4.64m for the hill height because The total energy limit for the roller coaster is the PE that's calculated before the ride starts because the Conservation of Energy states that energy is never created or destroyed. This suggests that when the roller coaster meets the top or near the top of the hill after the initial drop, it'll fall back down because there won't be enough total and PE to make it over again. I chose a mass of 50kg for my roller coaster car because a higher car mass and the speed are the same as a lower car mass and speed because my data shows when I have a car mass of 60kg and measure the speed at the end of the ride which was 9.88m/s, it will be the same as when I set the car mass at 40kg when the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88m/s. This shows that the mass of any car doesn't affect the speed of the roller coaster. The Law of Conservation of Energy affects my design choices because the law of conservation states that energy can't be created nor destroyed. Total energy tells us that while the roller coaster runs, the PE is transferring and not being created then destroyed then created again after going down this roller coaster.\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "88", "Raw": "65", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.4887", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.7454", "Comprehensive": "0.6171", "Content Unit": "0(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 11(3), 12(3), 13(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 34(2), 35(2), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

This roller coaster design will make it to the end of the ride because the initial drop is higher off the ground and has more potential energy than the hill, which is not as high, and has less PE at the top. This is important because if the initial drop has more potential energy at the top it will have more kinetic energy at the bottom when the PE is transferred to KE on the way down the initial drop this is according to our \"initial drop\" data, trial #5 the coaster had 2443 J of PE at the top of the initial drop and 2442 J of KE at the bottom after the PE had been transferred to KE.\n\nThe relationship between PE, KE, and total energy affects the ride because when PE increases at the top of the ride the KE at the bottom of the ride will increase, and when PE decreases at the top of the ride KE will decrease at the bottom. So if the potential energy at the top of the initial drop increases, the ride will be faster at the bottom because there is more KE at the bottom of the drop. Total energy affects the ride because when all the energy is added up it cannot exceed or be lower than the total energy, the total energy limits PE and KE.\n\nPE and KE change when the roller coaster car moves down a hill because when the coaster car goes down the hill the potential energy it had at the top is transferred to kinetic energy as it goes down.\n\nThere is a relationship between initial drop height and hill height because if the initial drop height is greater than the hill height, the car will make it to the end of the ride. But if the initial drop height is less than or equal to the hill height it will not make it to the end. this is because at the top of the initial drop the PE has to be greater than the PE at the top of the hill or there will not be enough kinetic energy to make it over the hill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeight affects PE and KE because when height increases PE also increases, and when PE increases at the top, KE will increase at the bottom. one example of this is from initial drop height trial 1 and trial 4. During trial 1, I dropped the car from 5 m and it had 2443 J of PE at the top. During trial 4 I dropped the car from 2 m and it had 977 J of PE at the top.\n\n\nMass affects PE and KE because when Mass increases PE also increases, and when PE increases at the top, KE will increase at the bottom.  one example of this is from Mass & energy trial 1 and trial 4. In trial 1 the car mass was 40 kg and had 1958 J of PE and in trial 4 the mass was greater at 60 kg and had 2937 J of PE. This is important because it shows the difference in PE between 60 kg mass and 40 kg mass. 60 kg mass had greater PE.\n\nThe heights of the roller coaster get consecutively smaller as the roller coaster goes on so that the roller coaster will get to the end without stopping. This is important because if the hills are larger or equal in height to the hill before them, then the roller coaster will not make it over the hill. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. It states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed. This affects my decision because if the hills are larger or equal to the hill before them, they will need more energy than they already have.\n\nI chose the roller coaster to have a 3.5 m initial drop and a 3 m hill because it is the fastest the coaster can go without being dangerous.

With the hill height of 3.25 m the PE and the KE the PE energy at the start would be 2078 Joules while the KE would be at zero Joules although, throughout the ride, the PE energy will go down while the KE energy will go up to 1563 Joules by the end of the ride, unlike the PE energy it will go to zero Joules at the end of your roller coaster ride. Lastly, the mass and energy if the mass of the car is to go up the PE and the KE will go up but the PE will be bigger at the start of the ride while the KE energy will be bigger at the end of the ride for example if we had the total of 60 kg for the car mass the PE energy will start at 2933 Joules while the KE energy would be at zero Joules although by the end of the ride the PE energy will be at zero Joules and the KE energy will be at 2927 Joules with that data the total energy would 2933 for your roller coaster ride.\n\nWith mass, height, and speed many things come into play for example the drop in height and speed these two affect one another.

Although when it comes to your car mass and speed they don't affect each other because no matter the mass of your car the speed will always stay the same if you choose to keep the same roller coaster the only way your speed would change would be with the initial drop height, hill height, and the mass and energy come into play otherwise if you change the mass of your car the speed will not be affected.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "25", "Raw": "29", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 84", "Quality": " 0.3452", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.3326", "Comprehensive": "0.3389", "Content Unit": "6(4), 10(3), 17(3), 19(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 35(2), 37(1), 43(1), 44(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 60 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... and the PE energy will go down and by the end of the ride the\n\t", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 20 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

Our roller coaster will make it to the end because our hill heights our lower than the initial drop and there is still energy for the loops so the roller coaster car will make it all the way through the track without stopping. The higher the initial drop is the more PE and KE and total energy there is.  The relationship between PE and KE and total energy is that the PE and the total energy are the same and KE is 1J under the PE and the total energy. An example was when the initial drop is 5m the PE at the top is 2443J, and the KE at the bottom of the drop is 2442J. Then the total energy is 2443J. When the roller coaster car moves down the hill the PE goes down and the KE goes up. The relationship between the initial drop height and the hill height is when a hill height is the same or higher than the initial drop height the roller coaster car will not make it over. In order for the roller coaster car to make it over the hill, the initial drop has to be higher than the hill height. The relationship between mass, PE, and KE is when the mass is greater the more PE and KE there is. For example, when the car was 60kg the PE at the top was 2349J and the KE at the bottom was 2336J. But when the cart only weighed 40kg the PE at the top of the initial drop was 1566J and the KE at the bottom of the drop was 1557J. \n\nThe heights of my roller coaster would be taller and higher. The reason I would make the heights higher would be because it creates more energy which helps make the ride have more speed. Having the roller coaster heights taller would also make it so the roller coaster car will make it through the track and to the end of the ride because it will have more energy. For example, when the height of the roller coaster was 5m the speed at the end of the ride was 9.88 m/s. But when the height was 3.08m the speed at the end of the ride was 7.76mThe mass of the roller coaster car would not be super heavy or super light. The mass would be in the middle or average because the mass of the roller coaster cart doesn't make that big of a difference. It might go a little slower if it is a lighter weight but faster if it was a heavier weight which is why I would do a middleweight like 50kg. The height and mass affect the energy and speed of our roller coaster because the greater the height and mass are the more energy it creates. The more energy there is being created the more speed the roller coaster car will have. The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy and how it affects the ride is when there is more energy there is more speed. When the energy is lower the roller coaster car will be slower and might not make it over hills or loops if it doesn't have enough energy. The Law of Conservation of Energy affects the design decisions because the speed cant is too fast or too slow like the speed cant be over 8.4 m/s. Which affects the decisions of height and mass.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "45", "Raw": "41", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 115", "Quality": " 0.3565", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4702", "Comprehensive": "0.4134", "Content Unit": "10(3), 11(3), 16(3), 17(3), 19(3), 20(2), 23(2), 27(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 55(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 59 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

Which also means that there's going to be more kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop because there was more friction to go through and get kinetic energy. For example, the height of trial 1 (initial drop) was 3.85, the potential energy at the top was 1894, and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1893. And when the height was 2.30 (trial 3, initial drop) the potential energy at the top was 1134 and then kinetic energy at the bottom was 1133. If there's more potential energy, there will be more kinetic energy because the more the track the more the energy. The potential energy as it goes down the track, the energy will drop. Because there is less track and then there's nowhere to go so there's going to be no potential energy or just a little but. For example, the potential energy at the initial drop of trial 1 (initial drop) was 1894, then at the bottom of the initial drop it was at 1 because there's nowhere else to go. Also, as the kinetic energy at the top isn't very much, it will have a lot more at the end of the ride because as it goes down, there's friction which makes kinetic energy. For example, for trial 1(initial drop) the kinetic energy at the top of the drop was at 0, then at the bottom it was at 1893 because there was friction which collects kinetic energy. The energy transfers as the friction as you're going down the ride makes kinetic energy. When your making a roller coaster, you need to make sure that your initial drop hill height is taller than your hill height. Because you need enough energy to be able to make it to the top of the other hill. The drop height cannot be taller than the other hill. If the car has more mass, then the potential energy and kinetic energy will be larger. For example, when the mass was 50 kg, the potential energy at the top was 1948, and the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop was 1945. Now, when it's 60 kg, (trial 4, mass & energy data), the potential energy at the top was 2320, and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2315. Which shows that when there's more mass, there's more energy. \n\nIf your initial drop is high, the speed at the bottom of the drop will be higher than if the initial drop height was shorter. From trial 3 of \"Drop Height And Speed\" from my data, the height of the initial drop was 5.00 m and the speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.81 m/s. And for trial 2 from my data was 3.16 m tall for the initial drop, and the speed at the bottom of the drop was 7.85 m/s. So, that shows how the height of the initial drop does affect the speed. I chose those heights for the initial drop because they are far apart from each other so there's a large difference and it will be easier to tell how it does or doesn't change more efficiently Now, when you have different masses for the same height of your initial drop, the speed doesn't change. For trial 1 of my data from \"Mass & Speed\" the mass of the car was 40 kg, and at the bottom of the initial drop was 8.84 m/s. Then, for trial 3 the mass of the car was 60 kg and the speed at the bottom of the drop was also 8.84 m/s. So, this shows that the mass of the car doesn't change the speed of the coaster. I decided to use 40 and 60 kg for the mass because they are the furthest apart, so it shows that even when they are super far apart, the mass is still the same. The height affects potential energy because if there's more track, then there's going to be more potential energy, and it affects kinetic energy as well because if it';s taller then it's going to have more kinetic energy because you went on more track so there's more friction to create kinetic energy. Mass doesn't affect potential or kinetic energy because mass doesn't affect the speed at all and it doesn't change how tall or long the track is and it's height. Potential energy and kinetic energy don't affect your ride because it doesn't change anything about how tall or long it is. The Law of Conservation of Energy affects your design decisions because you need to figure out how the height of your initial drop and your hills will affect your passengers, and to make sure that they are safe.

In my trials, the car on the roller coaster was going at 7.66 meters per second at the bottom of the 3-meter drop and 4.4 meters per second at the top of the 2-meter high hill, but when I tried it with a shorter drop height of 2.25 meters, it only went 6.63 meters per second at the bottom of the initial drop and 2.17 meters per second at the top of the same hill.  6.7 meters per second is how fast the car should go (at the minimum) to be fun, so this drop height will not be a good choice.  With the higher drop of 5 meters, the car had a much higher speed of 9.88 meters per second at the bottom of the drop and 7.65 meters per second at the top of the same 2-meter hill.  This is far too fast, as the maximum safe speed for a roller coaster is 8.4 meters per second.\n\nThe hill height should be about 2 meters.  It needs to be shorter than the initial drop because the height of the initial drop establishes the total energy for the entire ride.  The energy required to climb the hill cannot be higher than the PE at the top of the initial drop.  In my trials, with a 3-meter initial drop, the car could not get over a 3.26 or 3-meter hill, proving that roller coasters with hills higher than the initial drop are not possible using only mechanical energy.  However, both roller coasters with hills below 3 meters made it to the end of the ride.\n\nThe weight of the roller coaster car does not matter.  This is because a car with a higher mass will go at the same speed as a car with a lower mass.  I know this because, in my trials, I tried four different cars with masses of 40, 46, 54, and 60 kilograms.  All of these cars went at the same speed at the bottom of the drop.  However, it may be a good idea to pick a higher mass, as the car has more total energy when it has more mass due to the direct relationship between mass and energy.  When I used a car of 40 kgs and a car of 60 kgs on the same track, the one with the larger amount of mass had 2932 Joules of total energy, while the one with the lower mass had only 1955 Joules.\n\nThe Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy within a closed system will always remain constant.  When the car had more PE, it had more total energy, meaning a higher possible KE.  This is because PE turns into KE as the car goes into motion.  PE, or Potential Energy, is energy stored within an object.  PE can turn into KE, or Kinetic Energy.  KE is the energy of motion.  For example, the car has the highest amount of PE at the very top of the initial drop because it has the potential to go down the hill, but it is not currently moving.  The car has the highest amount of KE at the very bottom of the hills because it does not have the potential to fall, as it is sitting on the ground, but it has a lot of motion, or momentum, from going down the hill.  As the car goes down a hill, PE becomes KE.

In order for our ride to be safe, we need to have a maximum of 8.4 m/s speed. However, after testing we want to have the ride be greater than or equal to 6.7 m/s of speed in order to make it fun. The initial drop is important because it sets the amount of energy the ride will have. So, a greater height will have more potential energy at the top, kinetic energy at the bottom, and more total energy than a shorter height. We saw in our simulation that a 2.5 meter initial drop had 1222 joules of total energy and a speed of 6.91 m/s at the bottom of the drop. A 3 meter initial drop had 1466 joules of total energy and had a speed of 7.62 m/s at the bottom of the drop. Last, a 5 meter drop had 2443 joules of total energy and a speed of 9.88 m/s at the bottom of the drop. From these same trials, we can see that height and speed have a direct relationship. When we increased the initial drop we saw a greater speed at the end of the ride. For the 3 meter drop height, we had 7.65 m/s at the end of the ride. In the contrast, we had a 5 meter initial drop height and had 9.88 m/s at the end of the ride. This proves that a greater height resulted in greater speed. Therefore, I think that to have a fun, yet safe ride we should have a 3 meter initial drop.\n\nPotential energy is also known as stored energy, and kinetic energy is energy in use. The ride will have the same amount of energy throughout the whole thing, but the most potential energy at the start and the most kinetic energy at the bottom. This is because the Law of Conservation of Energy, it says that energy can't be created or destroyed. In this case, because there is no friction, the total energy will stay the same despite the potential and kinetic energy going up and down. When the car goes down the hill the kinetic energy increases as the potential energy decreases. When the car goes up a hill the kinetic energy decreases as the potential energy increases. The only reason that you would have less total energy at the end than at the beginning is because of friction. Friction does not make the car lose energy, but it converts the energy from the car into heat energy and it transfers from the car to the track.\n\nThe amount of potential energy at the top/start is so similar to the amount of kinetic energy at the bottom/end of the ride. Additionally, we know that the more mass an object has the more potential energy it will have. Because the potential energy at the top = the kinetic energy at the bottom a greater mass would also mean more kinetic energy at the bottom. We know that no hill can have a height higher or require more energy, to get up, than the initial drop. We can see this in our data. We set the simulation to have a 3 meter initial drop height. For any hill that was shorter than 3 meters, the car was able to make it over the hill and continue on. However, we saw that any hill that was higher than our initial height, of 3 meters, was not able to make it over the hill on its own. Therefore,  I think that a 2.5 meter hill is the best option so that the car can make it over the hill without an issue. \n\nLast, when you have a larger mass you will have more energy. We can look at both scientific equations and our data to see this. First, we'll look at our equation for potential energy which is weight X height, or mass X gravity X height. If we have a larger mass and we put it into the equation with the same gravitational pull and height, we will have more potential energy than we would have if we input a smaller mass. Next, we'll look at our equation for kinetic energy which is 0.5 X mass X velocity^2. If we have a larger mass and we put it into the equation with the same velocity, we will have more kinetic energy than we would have if we input a smaller mass. In our data, we were able to test this by only changing the mass of the car. At the top of our initial drop with a 40 kilogram car, we had 1,173 joules of energy at the top and 1173 joules of total energy. Consequently, when we had a 60 kilogram car we had 1,759 joules of energy at the top and 1759 joules of total energy. This proves that the more mass you have the more energy an object will have. However, I can also tell you that you can have any car mass because the mass does not affect speed. We know this because as seen in our trials PE(at the top)=KE(at the bottom). If we put the equations in here, we have m x g x h = Â½ x m x v^2. If we simplify this to be g x h = Â½ x v^2 the mass cancels out on both sides. We did trials as well to prove this. A 40 kg car has 7.65 m/s at the end of the ride. Consequently, the 60 kg car also had 7.65 m/s at the end of the ride. As you can see, no matter what the mass is, it does not affect the speed of the car, allowing you to choose any car.\n\nI think that the most important thing for you to remember is that energy is never created or destroyed and when you want a longer, more diverse ride, you want to have as much energy as possible so that it can make it to the end each time. That is why I think that the initial drop height, hill height, and car mass I explained are the best fit for your ride.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "83", "Raw": "76", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.5714", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.8716", "Comprehensive": "0.7215", "Content Unit": "0(5), 3(5), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 14(3), 15(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 20(2), 22(2), 27(2), 28(2), 29(2), 34(2), 36(1), 37(1), 39(1), 40(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 47(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 10 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... we have to follow with the height of our track\n\t", "sentence 5 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 17 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... m s of speed in order to make it fun.\n\t", "sentence 6 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 42 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

{"student_metadata": {"student_id": "62415f3957cc3a9535eae101", "class_id": "3", "teacher_id": "PN", "essay_number": 2, "essay_version": "R"}, "essay_text": "To start off, I would first like to explain what kinetic and potential energy is. Potential energy is the energy stored in the object or the energy that has the potential to move. Kinetic energy is the energy when the object is in motion. When the roller coaster goes down the hill, it transfers from potential energy to kinetic energy. When it hits the bottom of the hill and starts going back up again, it transfers back from kinetic energy to potential energy, and the cycle keeps on repeating. But no matter what, the energy never goes away (that is if it's frictionless if it's in the real world and has friction, the energy will be transferred to heat/thermal energy, which doesn't really help in the roller coaster situation). \n\nI would recommend for the Gonzales family, an initial drop height of 5 meters for the roller coaster. I believe that this is the best choice because the higher the initial drop, the more potential energy the car will have, and so therefore more kinetic energy as well. (Law of Conservation of Energy-energy cannot be created or destroyed, so the energy the car starts out with will be the most total energy the car will ever have so you might as well start out with the most energy you can possibly have to make it an exciting ride as possible). There is a direct relationship between the initial drop height and the energy the coaster will have. \n\nI think the mass of the car should be between 55-and 60 kilograms. I believe that this is the best choice because the more mass the car has, the more potential energy it will have (and therefore the more kinetic energy it will have). Since we want the car to be as fun and fast as possible, we want to choose a car with more mass so the car will have more energy to make it through the entire ride without stopping, while still going fast and having a good time. \n\nNext, I am going to be talking about the relationships between initial drop height and speed, and mass and speed. The first one is initial drop height and speed, which has a direct relationship. The higher the initial drop, the more speed the car will have. In the simulation, I tested out 4 different drop heights. If you want your roller coaster to be fun AND safe, I would suggest making the initial drop height somewhere between 3 and 4 meters tall. The second relationship is the one between mass and speed, which actually has no relationship at all. I also tested out 4 different car masses in the roller coaster simulation and found that no matter what the mass of the car is, the speed at the top and bottom of the drop will always be the exact same. So if you want your roller coaster to be able to hold more people at once, don't worry if it will affect the speed of your car, because it will always be the exact same. There is a direct relationship between mass and kinetic energy, and mass and potential energy. This means that the more mass, the higher potential/kinetic energy the car will have. And don't forget to consider that your roller coaster has to be fun AND safe, so you need to test out what car masses will end up with a speed somewhere between 6.7 and 8.4 m/s, so everybody will have a fun time. \n\nAnd lastly, I recommend that the Gonzales family chooses the height for the very first hill to be between 4 and 4.5 meters. I believe that this is the best option because the first rule is, don't make the hill height higher than or the same as the initial drop height. If you do that, the car will either just barely make it over the hill or make it up a few meters and then slide back down because it cannot create more energy than what it already has (which is what we're trying to avoid). As the car comes up the hill after the initial drop, its potential energy will increase until it hits its max (which will be less and less each hill) while the kinetic energy goes down really low, and then it will be at the top, and it will switch. Its potential energy will go down to 0 and its kinetic energy will go flying up until it hits its max (which will also be less and less each new hill it goes down), and then the cycle just keeps repeating itself. \n\nSo to conclude, I believe that the best options for a fun and safe roller coaster for the Gonzales family theme park would be an initial drop height somewhere between 3 and 4 meters, a car mass that will end up with a speed between 6.7 and 8.4 m/s (so probably somewhere between 40 and 50 kg), the height for the very first hill should be between 2.5 and 3 meters (and if you want to add more hills after that, you need to make them gradually get shorter and shorter otherwise the coaster won't have enough energy to make it up),  I hope this information was helpful, and I'm excited to see how the new coaster turns out!", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "60", "Raw": "70", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 130", "Quality": " 0.5385", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.8028", "Comprehensive": "0.6706", "Content Unit": "0(5), 1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 7(4), 14(3), 15(3), 18(3), 23(2), 27(2), 29(2), 32(2), 33(2), 34(2), 35(2), 37(1), 47(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 54 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

PE is short for potential energy, potential energy is the energy you have the potential of when getting ready to use it. KE is short for kinetic energy which is the energy being used at the moment. The height of the drop relates to the PE and the top because the higher it is the more of a fall it's gonna have and the faster it's gonna go giving it more PE, this would be a direct relationship. The height also affects KE at the bottom because the higher the height the faster the fall so when it's going faster with more energy at the bottom of the hill that would increase the KE, this is also a direct relationship. Mass does not affect the KE or PE because even when increasing the mass your ride will not go any faster or slower the only way to change that is by adding more or less height. PE KE and total energy are all related, the amount of PE you have is the same as the total energy at all times, and the amount of PE is the same as the KE at the bottom of the drop. KE is related to total energy because when the KE is at its most then that's what the total energy is too. The changes in PE and KE going down the drop are similar because the PE goes down the more you go and the KE goes up the more you go. The law of conservation of energy states that energy is not created or destroyed and that's why the total energy is always the same as the KE and PE, added up and it won't change unless something about the cart or the ride changes. The drop height and the hill height are also related, the higher the drop height is the more energy you will have to help cover the hill height, which is a direct relationship. If the hill height is higher than the drop height the cart will not pass because it does not have enough energy. The mass will change the PE and KE too because the more the mass the more the PE and the more the PE the more the KE.

The initial drop of the track is higher than any roller coaster we have ever made. The reason this is important is that the increased height results in more PE and KE.  PE is at its highest when the coaster cars are at the top of each hill, while KE is at its highest when the coaster cars reach the bottom of each hill.  PE and KE transfer to and from one another throughout the ride, as described in the Law of Conservation of Energy (which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed). In brief, the increase in the height of the initial drop will maximize the total energy and speed of the coaster cars throughout the entire ride, all the way to the finish.  It is important to note that none of the hills of the coaster can be higher than the initial drop.  This ensures there is enough total energy (PE + KE) to complete the ride.  Our tests show that while a super large hill in the middle of the coaster is a fun idea, it actually results in a loss of energy that would prevent the cars from reaching the end.  \n\nHere is some data from our recent trials. We have increased the initial drop height from 2.5 meters to 3 meters. This resulted in a 220-joule increase in energy, and a 0.67 meters per second increase in speed. We also discovered that the hills must be less than 3 meters tall. If it is any higher than that the coaster cars will not be able to make it to the end. Also, we tested adding mass to the cart thinking it would result in more speed. However, we found that the mass of the cart did not affect the speed at all, though it did make it harder to stop. \n\nIn order for the ride to be safe, the cart must not go over 8.4 meters per second. But to have the ride be fun, it should be over 6.7 meters per second. The reason we chose the height of the initial drop to be 3 meters tall, is because, at this height, the speed will be 7.66 meters per second, which meets both requirements and should be safe and fun. With all of this added energy and speed, this coaster will be super-fast and exciting from start to finish. We hope you consider our concept, The Frictionless Coaster. \n\nSincerely, \n\nThe Frictionless Coaster Team\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "34", "Raw": "42", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 102", "Quality": " 0.4118", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4817", "Comprehensive": "0.4467", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 10(3), 11(3), 12(3), 15(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 23(2), 33(2), 35(2), 50(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 59(1), 60(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 11 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: ....................

The first and most important part of your roller coaster is the initial drop. I think your initial drop height should be 4 meters because the increased height will give you just enough speed in this case 8.84 m/s so that you go as fast as possible with the ride still being safe. The increased height will also increase the potential energy at the top. The cart will have the highest potential energy at its highest point which in this case will be the initial drop. (potential energy is the energy you have standing still it depends on where the object is resting and how much mass the object has). The increased height at the top will also increase the kinetic energy at the bottom of the ride (kinetic energy is the energy you have moving it depends on the mass and velocity of the object. ). You may think the ride should have a height of 5 meters because that's the max height meaning it will be the max speed but the speed will increase to 9.19 m/s and that is not safe for humans. You may also think that the ride should be as safe as possible and the height should be 2.25 well then the speed at the bottom would only be 6.63 m/s which wouldn't be fun\n\nThe next thing to think about is how to build your cars. I think your car should be 40 kg because the less weight on the car means the less material used and the less material used the less money you will likely spend on the car. Some people may say wouldn't you want a 60 kg car because then it will have more kinetic energy and speed. While the more mass might make the car have more potential energy at the top and more kinetic energy at the bottom it won't make an actual difference in the ride because mass doesn't affect speed and humans can't really feel kinetic energy so the increased kinetic energy won't do anything. \n\nOne of the most fun parts of a roller coaster is the hill now the important part to remember about a hill is that because of friction and the law of conservation of energy which states energy can't be created or destroyed no hill after the initial drop can be higher or equal to the height of the initial drop. This can be explained because when the cart is going down the initial drop all of its potential energy is being converted to kinetic energy and even though those numbers change they will always add up to the same number (maybe a little less because of friction) this is called the total energy so while the potential energy is dropping the kinetic energy will rise by the same amount the potential energy dropped. Now that we know this I think the hill height should be 3 meters. Because when your speed and kinetic energy are going down and your potential energy is going up as you climb the hill right at the top of the hill you will calm down before another huge drop down where you will gain speed and kinetic energy and lose potential energy and in turn gain lots of speed right before the end of the ride.\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "39", "Raw": "44", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 109", "Quality": " 0.4037", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5046", "Comprehensive": "0.4541", "Content Unit": "0(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 11(3), 15(3), 17(3), 20(2), 25(2), 32(2), 37(1), 42(1), 46(1), 47(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... how you should build your new roller coaster\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 52 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... because the increased height will give you just enough speed in\n\t         .................... this case\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 17 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... m s so that you go as fast as possible with the ride still being\n\t         .................... safe.\n\t", "sentence 5 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 11 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: ....................

I would like to inform you of different ideas I have to make your ride better. At the start of the For starters, when you are deciding what your initial drop will be, you must consider the fact that KE, PE, and height are directly related. If you are building a coaster that relies on itself (no machinery) after the initial drop, you will need a high initial drop. This is because The only force that does work on the mass is the force of gravity Since the force of gravity is a conservative force, the total energy is constant. Therefore, as the coaster travels through the ride, there is a continuous transfer between potential and kinetic energy. This is an example of a direct relationship. In a realistic environment, the amount of PE at the top of the initial drop will be greater than the amount of KE at the bottom of the drop. This is because, as the law explains: energy can't be created nor destroyed, instead the energy is converted into heat energy or less useful energy.\n\nThe simulation I produced was approximately 3.54 meters for the initial drop. Having an initial drop that is high enough for a fun ride, but also small enough to keep your passengers safe is very important. When you have an initial drop of 3.5 meters, there will be a substantial amount of PE compared to a 1-meter tall drop. Height affects speed (direct relationship) because according to my data, increasing the height of the drop will lead to a faster speed at the bottom of the hill. The cart gains more speed the higher the drop because gravity has more time to apply force to the cart. Height also affects PE and KE too. Increasing the height of the initial drop would also increase the amount of PE. At the bottom of the hill, there will also be an increase in KE aswell as total energy. KE is a form of energy that an object or a particle has by reason of its motion, and PE has stored energy When you have a large amount of potential energy at the top of the drop, you will get more energy that can be used for turns, corkscrews, hills, and more. \n\nNow that you have been informed about what I think the initial drop height should be, I think that we should begin talking about the hills, corkscrews, and other adrenaline-rushing add-ons. If you are going to add a hill to your coaster you must consider the amount of KE you have. At the bottom of the initial drop, you will have your desired amount of KE, but if you wanted a hill, the hill must be lower in height than the initial drop. If the hill was the same size or larger than the initial drop, the car won't make up over the hill. And because you don't have any electricity helping you up the hill, you will simply slide back down. This is an example of the relationship between PE, KE, and total energy. This is shown as a direct relationship and is in an account of the coaster because, at the top of the initial drop, the coaster will have a certain amount of PE.  Like the law of conservation of energy states, no energy can be created nor destroyed so where does the PE go? Well, the energy is converted into KE and is used when traveling down the hill. By the time the coaster we are at the bottom, you will know the amount of total energy you have (total between heat energy KE, PE, and more). \n\nThe roller coaster's hill heights and the initial drop are very important when it comes to having enough energy to get through the whole ride, but what about the cart's mass? Well, increasing the mass of the cart will lead to zero positive or negative effects. There will be nothing. This is because speed and mass don't have a relationship. Whether you have a car with a capacity of 20 passengers or 5 passengers, they will travel at the same exact speed. Although, mass does affect KE and PE directly. Even though increasing the mass of the cart doesn't matter when it comes to speed, it does matter when it comes to energy. Increasing the mass of the cart will increase the TE, PE, and KE. That doesn't necessarily mean it will make it faster even if it has more energy. \n\nAfter many experiments, analyses and simulations, I have come to the conclusion that I think that you should\n\nstart with a 3.54-meter initial drop. I believe this because after calculating the speed at the bottom of the drop, I found that it is between 8.4 meters per second and 6.7 meters per second. Secondly, I believe that you should have a 2.5-meter hill after the initial drop. This is reasonable because not only is it short enough for the cart to make it over, but it is also high enough for it to be \"belly-churning\". Finally, it's up to you what size your cart is. Whether it's massive or tiny. It won't matter. And with that, hopefully, my suggestions will assist you with your new ride!\nKind Regards,\nHayden Janus", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "70", "Raw": "58", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.4361", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6651", "Comprehensive": "0.5506", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 10(3), 13(3), 15(3), 19(3), 20(2), 23(2), 28(2), 29(2), 32(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 42(1), 44(1), 49(1), 50(1), 52(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1)", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 2": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... , you will need a high initial drop.\n\t", "sentence 5 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 44 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

So first up is the initial drop, I think that the height should be about 5 meters because then you will get the most speed and thrill. One reason why I say that is because when I did trials with the test rollercoaster when I made the initial drop, 5 meters it was guaranteed to make it to the end. But if you had the mass at 60Kg then that would be a problem. If you just made everything else smaller than 5 meters then everything was fine. A weight that I liked to use during my trials is 45Kg, this was because even though I make the hill high up the cart would still make it over no matter what. Also after the initial drop, it had more speed because of the mass forcing it forwards. With the friction being zero that will sure make it even more fun too! Now getting into more detail when the cart is at the top of the initial drop there will be a lot of Potential Energy making sure you get enough speed. Also, there will be little Kinetic Energy at first but then when you are going down the hill there will be a lot. When I did my trails I found that with the mass of the car being 45 instead of 50 or 40 the car at the initial drop had more Pontenial energy than normal and less Kinetic Energy than normal. \n\nInitial drop\n\nThere is a direct relationship between the height and the Potential Energy because depending on the height is the Potential energy of the cart. This is because when the car is sitting at the top of the initial drop that is telling you what the Kinetic Energy is and the Potential Energy are.  When you go down the initial drop the Potential Energy goes down and the Kinetic Energy goes up. This is because Potential energy is energy that is waiting to be changed into Kinetic Energy and Kinetic Energy is energy that is already being used. Like when you are standing still and leaning forward you have some Potential Energy and no Kinetic Energy because you are in place but want to move. The PE is affected by how high the initial drop is and that PE will only be used on that drop and then the KE would matter based on the PE for the initial drop.\n\nKinetic Energy and Potential Energy\n\nWhen you are talking about Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy that means a lot in roller coasters.  Like when does the cart has the most Potential Energy, and when does it have the most Kinetic Energy? Well, the cart has the most Kinetic Energy when the cart goes down the huge hill after the initial drop. This is because the cart transferred all of its Potential Energy into Kinetic Energy to get even more potential energy when it is going up the huge hill and waiting to go down the hill. Also, the mass does not affect anything with the speed and velocity you could have a cart full of people and an empty one race and it would be a tie. One more thing energy can not be created or destroyed but when you are riding a roller coaster than the Potential Energy changes to Kinetic Energy, not destroyed.\n\nIn this ride, there are Variables called Independent Variable, Dependent Variable, and Controlled Variable.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "44", "Raw": "54", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 114", "Quality": " 0.4737", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.6193", "Comprehensive": "0.5465", "Content Unit": "0(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 7(4), 9(4), 11(3), 13(3), 20(2), 22(2), 29(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 42(1), 45(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 54(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 52 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: .................... because then you will get the most speed and thrill\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 29 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: ....................

The reason that I think this is because the higher the cart is off the ground, the more potential energy and kinetic energy it has-potential energy because it is higher off the ground (height in the equation for potential energy) and kinetic energy because the more the cart drops, the more the velocity increases (speed in the equation for kinetic energy). More energy will make for a more exciting roller coaster.\n\nNow for the cart mass, you can go with whatever you would like, because mass does not affect speed, according to multiple sources, such as my trials in which a mass of 40 kg and 60 kg for the carts produced the same speed, and also the equations for calculating energy themselves, which simplify to velocity being unrelated to mass when set equal to each other. Just choose a mass that will work for you!\n\nI recommend that you go with 4.75 meters for the hill height, because it is maximum hill height you can have without the cart slowing down and failing to get over. This is because of the conservation of energy; the potential energy at the top of the initial drop cannot be greater than it is at any other point in the ride; if the hill was as tall as the initial drop, it would be impossible to get over it with the same total energy it had at the beginning of the ride. This is proven in that when I ran a trial where the initial drop and the hill height are the same, both at 5 meters, the cart failed to get over the hill.\n\nWhen the cart is at the top of the initial drop, all of its energy is potential energy (potential energy=total energy). As the cart goes down the hill, the potential energy decreases and the kinetic energy increases, but the total energy stays the same, because of the conservation of energy. Since we are in a friction less environment, the potential energy at the top will also equal the kinetic energy at the bottom, due to the conservation of energy. If we have more mass, we will also have more kinetic and potential energy because mass and both types of energy, kinetic and potential, are directly related. This is shown in that when I increased the mass from 40 kg to 60 kg, the energy increased from 1952 Joules to \n\nThank you for reading this letter from Samuel Park.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "30", "Raw": "47", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 94", "Quality": " 0.5000", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5390", "Comprehensive": "0.5195", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 9(4), 10(3), 11(3), 13(3), 14(3), 19(3), 21(2), 23(2), 33(2), 42(1), 50(1), 51(1), 53(1), 56(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 53 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

This is because the higher the drop is the more PE(energy stored up) there will be at the top of the coaster, and the more PE there is the more KE(energy in action/ being used) there is so there would also be more KE at the bottom of the drop, but we don't want it too high where it can be dangerous. So the higher the initial drop is the more energy the coaster will have, I know this because in one of my trials I put the initial drop height at 5 meters and one at 2.5 and the 5-meter tall initial drop got almost double the amount of energy the 2.5-meter drop got. And because the total energy is a combination of KE and PE, the total energy can't go up or down due to the Law of Conservation of Energy which states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. Next up a perfect hill height for this coaster would be 2.5 meters because it has to be less than 3.5 meters or else the cart will not make it up the hill because it doesn't have the energy for it. And it should be taller than 2 meters because if it isn't it's not very exciting and fun. And with this height, the cart can have its PE change into KE when going down to the bottom of the hill because it's no longer getting stored but when the cart rises back up to go above the hill that's when the PE stores back up and the KE goes down. PE and KE can both change but together they always equal the total energy. Now finally the cart weight that should be used for this rollercoaster doesn't matter because no matter what the weight of the cart is it will always have to be the same amount of PE and KE so it would not affect the speed. I know this from my trial when I put 4 different cart weights and they all had the same energy. And the cart will make it to the end because each hill will be smaller than the initial drop which will make the cart have enough energy to go over the hill/s due to the energy not being created or destroyed due to the Conservation of Energy. And PE at the top and KE at the bottom are related because when the cart is at the top it has the same amount of PE as KE it would have at the bottom. And if the cart's mass goes up so do the PE and KE, I know this from when I did a trial where I put the initial drop at 3 meters and put the mass of the cart at 50kg for one and 60kg for the other and the trial with the 60kg cart had more PE and KE.\n\nFrom Eli Mueller", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "37", "Raw": "48", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 107", "Quality": " 0.4486", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5505", "Comprehensive": "0.4995", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 6(4), 10(3), 13(3), 15(3), 16(3), 18(3), 19(3), 25(2), 32(2), 33(2), 34(2), 42(1), 44(1), 48(1), 50(1), 56(1), 57(1), 59(1), 60(1)", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 25 [Weight: 2]\n\tSegment: .................... but we do nt want it too high where it can be dangerous.\n\t", "sentence 3 Segment ID: 2": "Content Unit: 6 [Weight: 4]\n\tSegment: .................... the more PE there is the more KE energy in action being used there\n\t         .................... is so there would also be more KE at the bottom of the drop,\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 1": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

This is because the speed would be too dangerous if it was much higher. The G-Force of someone riding will be thrilling and fun. When the height was 4.75 meters, the speed was above 8.4 m/s/s. The mass could be almost anything without changing the speed, however, it could become dangerous or not thrilling to the rider. I recommend a mass of around 50 kg. To find the speed, the mass involved in the equation is canceled out. Therefore, the mass will not affect the speed no matter what. The transfer of energy between the car and track could affect the speed.\n\n             To understand what should be done with the rollercoaster we first need to know what components are necessary for success. First, the Law of Conservation of Energy says that energy can not be created or destroyed. It only changes forms and transfers. This law affects the rollercoaster because the PE, KE, and friction all can be changed. The Potential energy, which comes from its location at rest, changes from itself to Kinetic energy and heat energy. The heat energy is called friction. The energy in this situation is Potential Energy, Kinetic Energy, and total energy. Potential Energy is the energy that is stored based on the mass, gravity, and height of where an object starts. Kinetic Energy is the energy in use. The total energy is all of the energy combined. At the top of the hill, the PE will be equal to the total energy at the end (when there is no friction). In my experiment with no friction, the height was 2.25 meters. The PE at the top of the hill was 1098 Joules. In the end, there were 1098 Joules. With this same test, the PE at the bottom of the hill was 0 Joules. The Kinetic Energy was 1098 Joules. This shows that with no friction, the total energy will be the same as the PE at the top and the KE at the bottom. The PE is transferred to KE because the car is in motion. If the car was not moving, there wouldn't be any transfer of energy-related to KE. When going downhill, the KE increases, when going up, the KE will decrease and the PE will increase.\n\n            Now we can observe the relationships of the variables. The height of the drop relates directly to Potential Energy. This is because height is part of calculating the Potential Energy. To find the Potential Energy we use the equation PE=mgh. The \"m\" stands for mass, the \"g\" for gravity, and as I said before, \"h\" for height. Kinetic Energy is also directly related to height. This is because the Potential Energy, without friction, changes to Kinetic Energy. There can't be more energy than the original amount. This original amount is based on height, mass, and gravity. When deciding the hill height, it is important to compare it to the initial drop. If the hill is larger or the same height as the initial drop, the car will not make it over. This is because it would need more energy than what it started with. In another experiment, the hill was 4.75 meters and the initial drop was 4.25. When running the test, the car would go back and forth on the hills. The mass affects both the PE and the KE directly. If the mass is greater, so will the PE or KE. Mass is in both equations to find PE and KE.\n\n      Finally, the mass and the Potential Energy, as well as the Kinetic Energy, were all directly related. This is because in both of the equations for PE and KE there is mass in the equation. The equation for PE is PE=mgh. Mass is represented by \"m\" in both equations. The equation for KE is KE=1/2mv^2. The larger the mass, the more energy it has. This is shown in the tests when the mass of the car was 60 kilograms, the PE was 2785. When the mass was 56, the PE was 2600 at the top of the hill. This is the same with the KE at the bottom of the hill in each test. When on the way down the hill, the stored energy is transferred into the energy in use. For example, halfway down the hill, the PE could be 60 while the KE is 40. This means that at the top of the hill the PE was 100 Joules. This would only be true without friction. If there was friction, at the end of the roller coaster, the total energy between the PE and KE would be less than the original amount of PE.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "72", "Raw": "88", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.6617", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "1.0000", "Comprehensive": "0.8308", "Content Unit": "1(5), 2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 5(4), 6(4), 7(4), 10(3), 11(3), 13(3), 15(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 20(2), 21(2), 22(2), 25(2), 26(2), 27(2), 31(2), 32(2), 33(2), 34(2), 35(2), 36(1), 37(1), 40(1), 44(1), 46(1), 47(1), 48(1), 50(1), 51(1), 52(1), 53(1), 56(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 1 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 10 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: ....................

I know this because the PE for 5m is 2668J and 2666J KE at the bottom but for 4m the PE is 2134J and 2133 KE at the bottom, meaning that 5m will have the most energy. The height of the hills after the initial drop needs to be 4.01m. When compared to the PE and KE initial drop being 5m and the hill height being 4.01m we found that it was the highest height we tested that the car could go over the hill because the PE could successfully transport to KE (Law of Conservation Energy). We also know what ever PE started as at the top of the ride will always be the total energy during the ride. As the car goes down the hill we can automatically see the PE transforming into KE. Soon after we can see that the PE is VERY less than the KE because as it goes down the hill it transforms energy to PE to KE. The mass of the car should be 60kg because in our data we saw that 60kg has the most energy when we go down the hill and has the most total energy during the ride.

PE and KE impacted an affected speed because when our total energy is a higher number the speed will go faster and the PE will turn into KE quicker making the amount of total energy predict how fast the car is going to go.

This is due to the taller the height the more energy is put into the roller coaster.  If you have a taller initial drop, this will affect the PE and have a larger starting number for PE.  PE will start at the initial drop and shift into KE at the bottom of this drop.  Because of the Law of Conservation of Energy, the starting PE will shift into KE and still end with the same number for total energy.  For example, in trial one, the initial drop is five meters.  The PE at the initial drop was 2736J which shifted into 2735J for KE.  The total energy ended up being our starting PE which was 2736J.\n\nThe height of the hills after the initial drop needs to be smaller than the initial drop due to the energy.  If you have a hill that is higher than the initial drop, there wouldn't be a strong enough energy source to push the car through the hills.  For example, in trial one, the hill height was 3.02m which was a smaller hill than the initial drop.  The PE was 1923J and shifted into 439J for KE.  The car was able to go over the hill.  Whereas in trial two, the hill height was the same as the initial drop which was 5m.  The higher the height the more PE and KE there is.  The car was not able to make it over the hill.\n\nThe mass of the car affects the amount of PE and KE.  In trial four, the car mass was measured to be 60kg. The PE at the initial drop was 2937J which shifted into 2908J for KE.  Total energy was the same.  The lightest car mass was measured to be 40kg.  The PE ended up being only about 1958J which shifted into 1955J for KE.  Total energy was the same.  The heavier the car mass the more energy there is.\n\nThe initial drop height affects the speed of the car.  In trail one, the initial drop was at a height of 5m.  The speed at the bottom of the drop was 9.89m/s then shifted to about 4.37 m/s at the top of the hill.  The ending speed was measured at about 9.88m/s.  In trial two, the initial drop height was 4.04m.  The speed at the bottom of the drop was about 8.89m/s then shifted to about 0.54m/s.  The ending speed was 8.88m/s.  This shows that the higher the initial drop, the more speed the car has.\n\nThe mass of the car doesn't affect the speed.  In trial one, the mass of the car was 56kg.  The speed at the bottom of the drop was about 8.32m/s then shifted to 0.50m/s at the top of the hill.  The ending speed was 8.31m/s.  In trial two, the mass of the car was 40kg.  The speed at the bottom of the drop was 8.32m/s then shifted to 0.50m/s at the top of the hill.  The ending speed was 8.31m/s.  For each trial, the speed is always the same.  The speed will always be the same for any amount of mass a car has.\n\n", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "63", "Raw": "46", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 133", "Quality": " 0.3459", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.5275", "Comprehensive": "0.4367", "Content Unit": "1(5), 3(5), 6(4), 11(3), 16(3), 17(3), 18(3), 19(3), 27(2), 32(2), 34(2), 35(2), 37(1), 42(1), 44(1), 46(1), 50(1), 52(1), 56(1), 57(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 11 [Weight: 3]\n\tSegment: .................... the height the more energy is put into the roller\n\t", "sentence 4 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 57 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

This works because the higher the inital drop the higher the potential energy, and when the car goes down Potential energy goes down and Kenetic Energy goes up, this is shown in my data, when inital drop was 5 the pE was 2443 and KE was 0, as the car went down the PE went down and the KE went up, when the car was at the end the KE was 2443 and the PE was 0. so the total energy was 2443 because energy was not created or destroyed, it was the same all through out the ride.\n\nIf the rollar coster had a hill in the middel the hill can not be higher than the inital drop because then it would take nore energy that is builded up to get to the top of the hill, and you wont have that, this is shown in my data, the inital hight was 3 and the hill hight was 4 and the car wouldent go over, but when the mesurement where reversed the car was able to get over the hill. This shows that the inital drop will have to be higher than the hill hight, just so it can get over it.\n\nWith no friction mass does not affect speed/energy at all, this is shown in my data by when the mass of my car was 40kg the speed of the car was 8.27m/s, but when i made the mass higher the speed did not change at all, the mass was 60kg and the speed was still 8.27m/s. this shows that mass does not affect speed/energy. \n\nHeight impacts speed because in my Drop height and speed data i changed the height to see how it would affect the speed, and it seemed like whenever i made the height go down the energy/speed did to, the same thing happend when the height went up the speed/energy went up to. An example of this is when the inital drop height was 5m the speed of the car was 9.88m/s but when i but the inital drop height to 3.50 the speed was 8.27m/s. \n\nThe law of conservation of energy affects how i can build the rollar coaster because it states, energy cannot be created or destroyed, this means when the car is at the top it has a set amount of energy it can get to, this is also called PE/ Potential Energy. When the car goes down the PE goes down as well but the energy is not leaving, because it cant, it is becomeing something diffrent, it is becoming KE/Kenetic Energy which is the amount of energy it is gaining, but this can never excead the amount of energy the PE said it could. So that means the PE affects the KE and they both affects the ride because it affects how fast it can go, the amount of  PE is determind by the height, the higher the height the higher the amount of PE.", "log": {"No. of segments in the summary": "31", "Raw": "40", "Maximum possible score with Raw": " 96", "Quality": " 0.4167", "Average No of SCUs": "26.6", "Maximum score with average No of SCUs": " 87.2", "Coverage": "0.4587", "Comprehensive": "0.4377", "Content Unit": "2(5), 3(5), 4(4), 6(4), 17(3), 19(3), 20(2), 27(2), 34(2), 35(2), 44(1), 47(1), 50(1), 52(1), 54(1), 57(1), 60(1), 62(1)", "sentence 2 Segment ID: 0": "Content Unit: 50 [Weight: 1]\n\tSegment: ....................

And while this is true and a 5.00 meter tall would make it very fast, it would be too fast. The fastest a roller coaster could go without harming its riders is 8.4 m/s, and when the initial drop height was 5.00 m, it was going at a speed of 9.8 m/s. That is way too fast for a human body to handle. Because of this, I chose an initial drop height of 3.50 meters because it was fast enough to, well be fast, but also to not injure any riders while still being fun. But, because the initial drop height was shortened, so will the hill height. I changed the hill height to 2.00 meters tall because with an initial drop height of 3.50 m, it is steep enough for it to be fun, but also easy for the car to get over. \n\nI decided to keep the mass the same as in the 'Mass & Energy' experiment, a mass of 60 kg. I decided this because of the loss in height. Because there is less height in the initial drop, there is less potential energy at the beginning of the ride. So, I think that a mass of 60 kg would benefit the roller coaster because in the previous labs, it lead to more potential energy at the beginning of the ride, which I think would benefit the ride due to the fact that it has to make up for the loss of starting height. \n\nHowever, what I learned shocked me. When I tested the 5 different masses, it seemed as though there was no change in speed. I learned later that this is because of the relationship between potential energy and kinetic energy are unrelated because the mass in the equations cancel each other out, meaning that in a friction less world, mass and speed are unrelated to each other.

It will give the car the maximum amount of PE it can have for the ride. In the simulation, the maximum height was 5 meters and the minimum was 2 meters. The PE at the top of the initial drop when it was 5 m tall was at 2443 J. When it was only 2 m tall, the PE was at only 977 J. Since we want enough energy to last the entire ride, we want to have the most PE at the start to get us going. \n\nThe height of the hills after the initial drop can be any height as long as it's shorter than the initial drop. When the hill height was shorter than the initial drop in the simulation, the car would make it over and finish the ride, but if the height is the same or taller than the initial drop, there won't be enough KE to make it over, meaning the car will get stuck and the ride will end before it finishes. \n\nThe mass of the car should be as big as possible. If we want to have the most PE at the start of the ride, we want the mass of the car as large as possible because then the car will have the most PE it could have for the ride. In the simulation, when we made the car mass 60 kg, the PE at the top of a 5 m initial drop was 2935 J, and by the time it reached the bottom of the drop, the KE was 2934 J. When the car mass was 40 kg on a 5 m initial drop, it only had 1957 J of PE at the top and only 1952 J of KE at the bottom. \n\nIn order to get the fastest speed while still keeping the riders safe, I tested six different initial drop heights and one hill height (3 meters) to see which gave the car the fastest speed while still keeping the riders safe. I found that the hills that were over 4 meters tall went too fast for a safe ride and under 3 meters was too slow. When I tested a 3.55 meter tall initial drop with the 3 meter hill, I found that that was the best combination. The car was going 8.34 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop, which is not too fast, 3.35 m/s at the top of the hill, which wasn't too slow and boring, and 8.33 m/s at the end of the ride, which means the ride was still super fast but not to the point where it could be dangerous. \n\nMass does not affect speed. When I tested different masses on the exact same ride, I found that all the speeds were the same, 8.34 m/s at the bottom of the initial drop, 3.25 m/s at the top of the hill, and 8.33 m/s at the end. I tried 4 different car masses and all of them had the same speeds. The rate of gravity is always 9.8 m/s^2. The velocity, height, and rate of gravity are unrelated to mass. Mass is the same at the top of the ID as it is at the bottom, so those numbers cancel each other out. Mass does not affect your speed in a frictionless environment.

For example. At the bottom of a 5-meter drop, the cart has a PE of 13J, but a KE of 2430J. When the car moves the PE, KE, and total energy shows their relationship by determining the KE at the top and bottom of the hill. A cart needs a high number of KE at the top of the hill to keep going. For example a hill height of 4.75m results in a KE of 8J, just barely enough to make it to the end. A hill height of 5m will not be enough to make it to the end of the coaster. When the car moves down a hill the PE+KE show their change by adding more hills and other things. As long as there is enough KE to make it up a hill, it'll make it to the end. Any KE under 8 at the top of the hill won't make it to the end because it's too high and there isn't enough energy to make it to the top. Unless you want a coaster that never ends. Energy transformation and the Law of Conservation relate to each other with their rules. The Law of Conservation neither increases nor decreases.  Energy transformation swaps between things like KE, PE, friction, etc. But the Law of Conservation negates these things from increasing and/or decreasing the total energy. The relationship between the initial drop height and the hill height is the energy up and down the hill. PE and KE switch at the top and bottom of the hill. There typically is more KE at the bottom of the hill than at the top of the hill. The PE at the top of the hill is a larger number, and KE at the bottom is higher. The relationship between mass and KE+PE is how it goes up and down the track. Most of the time, a heavier object has a harder time going up a hill than down the hill. This means that KE at the bottom of the hill is way higher than the top of the hill if it even makes it to the top. No matter the mass, the speed of the car is the exact same. An example of this is where the mass of the car was 40kg,50kg, and 60kg. All speeds measured were the exact same. The height of the coaster impacts the speed of the car. According to the trials, a drop height of 5 had sped up to 9.88 m/s. While a drop height of 3.5 was the perfect drop height with speeds up to 8.7 m/s. The Law of Conservation affected my thinking for my design because of how it affected the energy in the coaster. The coaster speed starts and ends with the same amount of energy. If the energy starts at 9999, it'll end with the same number. My final recommendation for a coaster would be a coaster with a drop height of 3.5m, with loops and hills galore! As long as the height of them gets lower and lower, then the coaster wouldn't have enough energy to make it to the end. The sky is the limit, as long as you understand that PE and KE are crucial factors when designing a coaster.
