Matter is stuff that all substances in the universe is made .
It 's everywhere .
Since matter takes up space
and takes up a certain amount of it
, all matter can be detected and measured the way you classify these is by their physical properties things like is it a solid , liquid or gas , how much it weighs , basically the makeup .

Energy is closely related to matter .
because it 's a property of matter

Matter can undergo either physical or chemical change .
A physical change is changing like size and shape without changing the chemical properties
but a chemical is exactly their changing .
