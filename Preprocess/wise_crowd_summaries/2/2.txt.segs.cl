Matter can either observed easily with an individual 's senses , or in a more challenging capacity .
Examples the text gives of types of matter that are easy to identify with sight and touch senses
are : rocks , trees , bicycles , and different kinds of animals .

Types of matter more challenging to observe are : dust mites and air .
Dust mites are too small for the naked eye but can be found in furniture and rugs , and air argues it can be felt with help of the wind , bending the tree branches .

Matter can be classified by two separate properties : physical and chemical .
Physical properties can be observed without having to change the make-up , or identity of the matter .
Matter has several different physical properties that are outlined in the article .
Examples of physical properties are : density , ductility , malleability , boiling point , melting point , electrical conductivity , and solubility .
The author references clay as an object that is malleable .
as it has the ability to take different forms by pressing or pounding on it
The author references clay as an object that is malleable as it has the ability to take different forms by pressing or pounding on it .
Chemical properties however , describe matter based on its ability to change into matter with different properties .
Examples of chemical properties are flammability and rusting , .
as the object is no longer made of the same matter
Examples of chemical properties are flammability and rusting , as the object is no longer made of the same matter .
The difference between physical and chemical change is that physical change only relates to the size and shape of the object
, the matter the object is made up of remains the same .

Unlike physical change , chemical change occurs when the chemical properties of the matter have changed and a new substance is produced .

The author keeps the original type of matter : paper
, and explains by applying fire to the paper and letting it burn , the ash , gas
, and smoke you 're left with is not paper any longer .

The law of conservation of energy is a rule associated with forms of energy .
This law explains .
that energy comes several forms and can not be created or destroyed
This law explains that energy comes several forms and can not be created or destroyed .
This law explains that energy comes several forms
and can not be created or destroyed .
Energy can only be transferred from one object or system to another .
Mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of its motion or position .
The two kinds of mechanical energy are : kinetic and potential .
Kinetic energy is the energy an object has .
because it is moving
Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because it is moving .
The author asserts a parallel between speed/mass and kinetic energy , the greater the speed and mass of an object , the greater the kinetic energy .
