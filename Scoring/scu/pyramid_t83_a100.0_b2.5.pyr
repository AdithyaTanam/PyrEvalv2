SCU	0	4	experts Most auto safety believe the seat belt is the single most effective auto safety device .
SCU	0	4	Volvo luxury models featured computerized stability and traction control , advanced antilock braking , new seats offering improved whiplash protection in rearend crashes , and an inflatable curtain , Volvos version of a side airbag system to protect the driver and front passenger in side collisions .

SCU	11	2	systems Antilock brakes , computerized stability and traction control , allwheel drive , lowtirepressure detectors , reverse sensing , better suspension and handling , and bluetint headlights all contribute to this end .
SCU	11	2	Antilock brakes are a very important safety factor and some autos have adjustable pedals .
SCU	12	2	Air bags exerting less force were developed .
SCU	12	2	Dual inflation levels for air bags are proposed .

SCU	14	2	drive All wheel , which helps prevent a vehicle from skidding on snow or ice ,
SCU	14	2	since some bags inflating in low speed crashes have been blamed for killing several people , mostly children
SCU	15	2	Some models came equipped with tires capable of running for some time after sustaining a flat , thereby letting the driver obtain help or find a safe place to change the tire .
SCU	15	2	Other safety devices in limited use are reverse sensing devices to warn of the closeness of objects behind the car and sensors to warn of low tire pressure .
SCU	16	2	they Dual front air bags became standard equipment , but
SCU	16	2	curtains Mercedes and BMW had airbag that inflate across car windows and
SCU	17	2	Air bags were introduced in the s and were credited with saving many lives .
SCU	17	2	automakers Many initially resisted the introduction of safety features , such as airbags , claiming they were unwanted by consumers .
SCU	18	2	In January the National Transportation Safety Board asked all states to set up fitting stations .
SCU	18	2	By the model year , many were offering safety features to help promote sales .
SCU	19	2	states Some are enacting laws to require seat belt usage and some auto makers are installing audio and visual signals to show when
SCU	19	2	variety of designs tended to mystify owners and many seats were installed incorrectly so as to be ineffective .
