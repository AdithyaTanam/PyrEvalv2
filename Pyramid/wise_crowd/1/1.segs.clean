Some types of matter are easily observable with the senses but
To classify matter one must identify the physical and chemical properties .
The physical properties are those that can be observed without changing the matter itself .
Examples of physical property are malleability , boiling point , melting point , solubility , and others .
The chemical properties involve changing the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties .
Examples of this are rusting and flammability , .
because it systematically changes the matter itself
Examples of this are rusting and flammability , because it systematically changes the matter itself .
The primary difference between a physical and chemical change is the changing of the substance into a new matter in a chemical change .
By changing the physical property of the substance , the matter itself does not change
, but in a chemical change the substance itself becomes something new .
