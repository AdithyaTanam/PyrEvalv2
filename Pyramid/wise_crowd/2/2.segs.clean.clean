matter can be classifi by two separ properti physic and chemic 
physic properti can be observ without have to chang the make up or ident of the matter 
matter ha sever differ physic properti that ar outlin in the articl 
exampl of physic properti ar densiti ductil malleabl boil point melt point electr conduct and solubl 
the author refer clai as an object that is malleabl 
as it ha the abil to take differ form by press or pound on it

chemic properti howev describ matter base on it abil to chang into matter with differ properti 
exampl of chemic properti ar flammabl and rust 
as the object is no longer made of the same matter

the law of conserv of energi is a rule associ with form of energi 
thi law explain 
that energi come sever form and can not be creat or destroi 
thi law explain that energi come sever form and can not be creat or destroi 
thi law explain that energi come sever form 
and can not be creat or destroi 
energi can onli be transfer from on object or system to anoth 
mechan energi is the energi an object ha becaus of it motion or posit 
the two kind of mechan energi ar kinet and potenti 
kinet energi is the energi an object ha 
becaus it is move 
kinet energi is the energi an object ha becaus it is move 
the author assert a parallel between speed mass and kinet energi the greater the speed and mass of an object the greater the kinet energi
