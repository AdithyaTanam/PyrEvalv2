5.0	5	2.2.1.0 | defines matter as the stuff that all objects and substances substances in the universe are made of .
5.0	5	4.8.0.0 | For example , its shape , size , malleability , and density are all properties we can observe without fundamentally changing the matter .
5.0	5	1.9.1.0 | , but in a chemical change the substance itself becomes something new
5.0	5	5.10.0.0 | There is also a physical and chemical change that exists in matter .
5.0	5	3.2.0.0 | Matter is identified as being present everywhere and in all substances .
4.0	4	4.1.0.0 | In What is Matter ?
4.0	4	2.15.1.0 | , the matter the object is made up of
4.0	4	1.1.1.0 | Matter is what makes up all objects or substances
4.0	4	5.1.0.0 | Matter is all the objects and substances that take up space around us .
4.1	4	1.2.0.0 | Some types of matter are easily observable with the senses
4.1	4	2.3.0.0 | All matter has the ability to be detected and measured .
4.1	4	4.4.0.0 | We can detect matter .
4.1	4	5.2.0.0 | Matter can be detected and measured .
3.0	3	2.13.0.0 | Chemical properties however , describe matter based on its ability to change into matter with different properties .
3.0	3	5.8.0.0 | Chemical properties of matter are characterized by their ability to change into a new substance with different properties .
3.0	3	1.6.0.0 | The chemical properties involve changing the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties .
3.1	3	5.5.0.0 | Physical and chemical properties are the two main types of properties used to classify matter .
3.1	3	1.3.0.0 | To classify matter one must identify the physical and chemical properties .
3.1	3	2.8.0.0 | Matter can be classified by two separate properties : physical and chemical .
3.2	3	5.13.1.0 | Energy is related to matter because all matter is made up of energy .
3.2	3	3.5.0.1 | that matter can be broken down into physical properties and chemical properties
3.2	3	4.6.0.0 | Scientists classify matter based on its physical and chemical properties .
2.0	2	2.19.1.1 | , and all matter has it .
2.0	2	4.13.0.1 | , all matter has it .
2.1	2	2.17.0.0 | Unlike physical change , chemical change occurs the chemical properties of the matter have changed and a new substance is produced .
2.1	2	1.9.1.1 | By changing the physical property of the substance , the matter itself does not change , but in a chemical change the
2.2	2	5.6.0.0 | Physical properties are observed without changing the identity of the object .
2.2	2	2.9.0.0 | Physical properties can be observed without having to change the make-up , or identity of the matter .
2.3	2	5.11.1.0 | The difference between a physical and chemical change is that a chemical change will create a new substance while all the chemical properties in a physical change will not change .
2.3	2	3.6.0.0 | Physical properties can occur without changing the identity or nature of the matter .
2.4	2	3.1.0.1 | , mainly focused on the topic of matter and its components .
2.4	2	1.10.0.0 | All matter has energy , .
1.0	1	2.5.0.1 | are : rocks , trees , bicycles , and different kinds of animals .
1.1	1	2.5.1.0 | Examples are : rocks , trees , bicycles , and different kinds of animals
1.2	1	2.7.1.1 | but can be found in furniture and rugs
1.3	1	2.7.2.0 | Dust mites but can be found in furniture and rugs
1.4	1	2.7.2.1 | are too small for the naked eye
1.5	1	2.7.3.2 | but can be found in furniture and rugs , and air although
1.6	1	2.7.4.2 | but can be found in furniture and rugs , and air although ca n't be seen the
1.7	1	2.7.5.0 | argues it can be felt with help of the wind , bending the tree branches
1.8	1	2.7.5.2 | but can be found in furniture and rugs
1.9	1	2.16.0.0 | The author provides an example of a sheet of paper folded into thirds , and is shaped differently , it is still paper .
1.10	1	2.16.1.0 | The author provides an example of a sheet of paper folded into thirds , although the new paper size is now one third of the original
1.11	1	2.16.2.0 | The author provides an example of a sheet of paper folded into thirds , although the new paper size is now one third of the original and is shaped
1.12	1	2.16.3.0 | The author provides an example of a sheet of paper folded into thirds , although the new paper size and is shaped differently
1.13	1	2.16.3.1 | is now one third of the original
1.14	1	2.16.4.1 | The author provides an example of a sheet of paper folded into thirds , although the new paper size is now one third of the original
1.15	1	2.18.3.0 | , and smoke you 're left with
1.16	1	4.5.0.0 | Common examples are solids like a bed and a bug , liquids like water and milk , and gas like air and smoke .
