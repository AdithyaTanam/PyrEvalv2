3.0	3	5.5.0.0 | Physical and chemical properties are the two main types of properties used to classify matter .
3.0	3	1.3.0.0 | To classify matter one must identify the physical and chemical properties .
3.0	3	2.8.0.0 | Matter can be classified by two separate properties : physical and chemical .
3.1	3	3.7.1.0 | It is important to know that if the physical properties such as the size and shape of an object changes , the chemical properties does not change .
3.1	3	2.15.1.1 | The difference between physical and chemical change is that physical change only relates to the size and shape of the object , the matter the
3.1	3	1.9.1.1 | By changing the physical property of the substance , the matter itself does not change , but in a chemical change the
2.0	2	5.6.0.0 | Physical properties are observed without changing the identity of the object .
2.0	2	2.9.0.0 | Physical properties can be observed without having to change the make-up , or identity of the matter .
2.1	2	3.6.0.0 | Physical properties can occur without changing the identity or nature of the matter .
2.1	2	5.10.0.0 | There is also a physical and chemical change that exists in matter .
2.2	2	2.22.1.0 | This law explains that energy comes several forms and can not be created or destroyed .
2.2	2	5.15.1.0 | This rule indicates that energy can not be destroyed it moves from one object or system to another .
2.3	2	2.18.0.1 | , and explains by applying fire to the paper and letting it burn , the ash , gas
2.3	2	5.9.0.0 | For example , paper burning into ash and irons ability to rust .

1.1	1	2.2.1.0 | defines matter as the stuff that all objects and substances substances in the universe are made of .
1.2	1	2.2.2.0 | defines matter as the stuff that all objects and substances in the the universe are made of .
1.3	1	2.3.0.1 | as it takes up space defined as volume and contains a certain amount of material defined as mass
1.4	1	2.3.1.0 | All matter has the ability to be detected and measured as it takes up space defined as volume and contains a certain amount of material defined as mass .
1.5	1	2.3.2.0 | All matter has the ability to be detected and measured as it takes up space defined as volume

1.8	1	2.5.1.0 | Examples are : rocks , trees , bicycles , and different kinds of animals
1.9	1	2.6.0.0 | Types of matter more challenging to observe are : dust mites and air .
1.10	1	2.7.0.0 | Dust mites are too small for the naked eye but can be found in furniture and rugs , and air argues it can be felt with help of the wind , bending the tree branches .

1.21	1	2.7.5.0 | argues it can be felt with help of the wind , bending the tree branches
1.22	1	2.7.5.2 | but can be found in furniture and rugs
1.23	1	2.7.5.3 | , and air although ca n't be seen the author argues
1.24	1	2.12.0.0 | The author references clay as an object that is malleable .
1.25	1	2.12.0.1 | as it has the ability to take different forms by pressing or pounding on it
1.26	1	2.14.0.1 | as the object is no longer made of the same matter
1.27	1	2.15.0.1 | , the matter the object is made up of remains the same .
1.28	1	2.16.0.0 | The author provides an example of a sheet of paper folded into thirds , and is shaped differently , it is still paper .

1.44	1	2.19.0.0 | In conclusion , the author explains , and all matter has it .
1.45	1	2.19.1.0 | In conclusion , the author explains that energy is related to matter as it is defined as a property of matter
1.46	1	2.19.2.1 | has it .
1.47	1	2.19.4.0 | In conclusion , the author , and all matter has it
1.48	1	2.20.0.1 | , energy is very essential .
1.49	1	2.20.1.0 | , energy is very essential
1.50	1	2.22.2.0 | This law explains that energy comes several forms
1.51	1	2.26.0.1 | because it is moving
1.52	1	2.27.0.0 | The author asserts a parallel between speed/mass and kinetic energy , the greater the speed and mass of an object , the greater the kinetic energy .
1.53	1	3.1.0.1 | , mainly focused on the topic of matter and its components .

1.59	1	3.7.0.0 | It is important to know .
1.60	1	4.3.1.0 | Matter is anything that has mass
1.61	1	4.3.2.1 | that has mass and
1.62	1	4.4.0.1 | because it does have mass and take up space
1.63	1	4.5.0.0 | Common examples are solids like a bed and a bug , liquids like water and milk , and gas like air and smoke .
