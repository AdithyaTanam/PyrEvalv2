5.0	5	3.3.5.0 | is that individuals are able to observe certain forms of matter using their senses while other forms are not so easily observed
5.0	5	1.2.0.0 | Some types of matter are easily observable with the senses
5.0	5	2.3.0.0 | All matter has the ability to be detected and measured .
5.0	5	4.4.0.0 | We can detect matter .
5.0	5	5.2.0.0 | Matter can be detected and measured .
5.1	5	2.2.1.0 | defines matter as the stuff that all objects and substances substances in the universe are made of .
5.1	5	4.1.0.0 | In What is Matter ?
5.1	5	1.1.1.0 | Matter is what makes up all objects or substances
5.1	5	3.2.0.0 | Matter is identified as being present everywhere and in all substances .
5.1	5	5.1.0.0 | Matter is all the objects and substances that take up space around us .
4.0	4	1.3.0.0 | To classify matter one must identify the physical and chemical properties .
4.0	4	4.6.0.0 | Scientists classify matter based on its physical and chemical properties .
4.0	4	5.5.0.0 | Physical and chemical properties are the two main types of properties used to classify matter .
4.0	4	2.8.0.0 | Matter can be classified by two separate properties : physical and chemical .
4.1	4	2.13.0.0 | Chemical properties however , describe matter based on its ability to change into matter with different properties .
4.1	4	4.2.0.0 | , we learn the definition of matter , its properties , and matter relates to energy .
4.1	4	5.8.0.0 | Chemical properties of matter are characterized by their ability to change into a new substance with different properties .
4.1	4	1.6.0.0 | The chemical properties involve changing the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties .
4.2	4	2.3.3.1 | takes up space defined as volume and
4.2	4	1.1.1.1 | and contains both volume and mass .
4.2	4	4.3.1.1 | and takes up space volume .
4.2	4	5.2.0.1 | because it contains volume and mass
3.0	3	5.6.0.0 | Physical properties are observed without changing the identity of the object .
3.0	3	3.6.0.0 | Physical properties can occur without changing the identity or nature of the matter .
3.0	3	2.9.0.0 | Physical properties can be observed without having to change the make-up , or identity of the matter .
3.1	3	1.7.0.0 | Examples of this are rusting and flammability , .
3.1	3	5.9.0.0 | For example , paper burning into ash and irons ability to rust .
3.1	3	2.14.0.0 | Examples of chemical properties are flammability and rusting , .
3.2	3	5.16.0.0 | An additional form of energy is mechanical energy .
3.2	3	1.11.0.0 | The law of conservation of energy is the notion .
3.2	3	2.25.0.0 | The two kinds of mechanical energy are : kinetic and potential .
3.3	3	3.3.5.1 | What is unique is that individuals are able to observe certain forms of matter using their senses while other
3.3	3	2.16.3.0 | The author provides an example of a sheet of paper folded into thirds , although the new paper size and is shaped differently
3.3	3	5.7.1.1 | For example , clay can be molded into different shapes and sizes but the
2.0	2	2.19.1.1 | , and all matter has it .
2.0	2	4.13.0.1 | , all matter has it .
2.1	2	1.11.2.1 | but can not be created or destroyed .
2.1	2	2.22.2.1 | and can not be created or destroyed .
2.2	2	2.17.0.0 | Unlike physical change , chemical change occurs the chemical properties of the matter have changed and a new substance is produced .
2.2	2	1.9.1.1 | By changing the physical property of the substance , the matter itself does not change , but in a chemical change the
2.3	2	5.11.1.0 | The difference between a physical and chemical change is that a chemical change will create a new substance while all the chemical properties in a physical change will not change .
2.3	2	3.7.0.1 | that if the physical properties such as the size and shape of an object changes , the chemical properties does not change
2.4	2	2.16.3.2 | , it is still paper .
2.4	2	4.11.0.0 | and it is no longer paper .
2.5	2	1.2.0.1 | but others are harder to identify without the assistance of a microscope .
2.5	2	3.4.0.0 | The latter requires the assistance of a specific instrument such as a microscope .
1.0	1	2.5.0.1 | are : rocks , trees , bicycles , and different kinds of animals .

1.2	1	2.7.1.0 | Dust mites are too small for the naked eye
1.3	1	2.7.2.0 | Dust mites but can be found in furniture and rugs
1.4	1	2.7.2.1 | are too small for the naked eye
1.5	1	2.7.3.1 | Dust mites are too small for the naked eye
