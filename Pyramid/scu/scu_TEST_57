5.0	5	5.5.0.0 | Physical and chemical properties are the two main types of properties used to classify matter .
5.0	5	1.3.0.0 | To classify matter one must identify the physical and chemical properties .
5.0	5	2.8.0.0 | Matter can be classified by two separate properties : physical and chemical .
5.0	5	3.5.0.1 | that matter can be broken down into physical properties and chemical properties
5.0	5	4.6.0.0 | Scientists classify matter based on its physical and chemical properties .
5.1	5	5.13.1.0 | Energy is related to matter because all matter is made up of energy .
5.1	5	1.10.0.0 | All matter has energy , .
5.1	5	3.1.0.0 | The passage , What is Matter
5.1	5	4.13.1.0 | , all matter has it
5.1	5	2.19.1.1 | , and all matter has it .
5.2	5	3.3.5.0 | is that individuals are able to observe certain forms of matter using their senses while other forms are not so easily observed
5.2	5	1.2.0.0 | Some types of matter are easily observable with the senses
5.2	5	2.3.0.0 | All matter has the ability to be detected and measured .
5.2	5	4.4.0.0 | We can detect matter .
5.2	5	5.2.0.0 | Matter can be detected and measured .
5.3	5	4.13.1.1 | Although you can not see or touch energy , all
5.3	5	1.10.0.1 | although it can not be seen or touched
5.3	5	3.7.0.0 | It is important to know .
5.3	5	2.20.0.0 | Although it ca n't be seen or touched like matter
5.3	5	5.10.0.0 | There is also a physical and chemical change that exists in matter .
5.4	5	3.1.0.1 | , mainly focused on the topic of matter and its components .
5.4	5	2.19.1.0 | In conclusion , the author explains that energy is related to matter as it is defined as a property of matter
5.4	5	5.12.0.0 | Another property of matter is energy .
5.4	5	1.7.0.1 | because it systematically changes the matter itself
5.4	5	4.12.0.0 | A final property of matter is energy .
4.0	4	5.15.0.1 | that energy can not be destroyed it moves from one object or system to another
4.0	4	4.4.0.1 | because it does have mass and take up space
4.0	4	1.11.0.1 | that energy can be transferred between objects but can not be created or destroyed
4.0	4	2.23.0.0 | Energy can only be transferred from one object or system to another .
4.1	4	2.3.0.1 | as it takes up space defined as volume and contains a certain amount of material defined as mass
4.1	4	1.1.1.1 | and contains both volume and mass .
4.1	4	4.3.1.1 | and takes up space volume .
4.1	4	5.2.0.1 | because it contains volume and mass
4.2	4	3.2.0.0 | Matter is identified as being present everywhere and in all substances .
4.2	4	5.4.0.0 | Properties are used to help us identify matter .
4.2	4	1.2.0.1 | but others are harder to identify without the assistance of a microscope .
4.2	4	2.5.1.1 | the text gives of types of matter that are easy to identify with sight and touch senses
4.3	4	4.9.0.0 | However , a chemical property requires the observer to change the essential , atomic identity of the matter .
4.3	4	1.12.0.1 | ; broken down there are two different kinds of mechanical energy .
4.3	4	5.16.0.0 | An additional form of energy is mechanical energy .
4.3	4	2.26.1.0 | Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because it is moving .
4.4	4	5.7.0.1 | but the molding does not change the substances in clay .
4.4	4	1.9.1.0 | , but in a chemical change the substance itself becomes something new
4.4	4	4.11.0.1 | paper burns , the paper 's atomic make-up is changed and it
4.4	4	2.16.2.1 | differently , it is still paper .
4.5	4	4.5.0.0 | Common examples are solids like a bed and a bug , liquids like water and milk , and gas like air and smoke .
4.5	4	5.7.0.0 | For example , clay can be molded into different shapes and sizes
4.5	4	2.2.0.1 | that all objects and substances in the universe are made of
4.5	4	1.5.0.0 | Examples of physical property are malleability , boiling point , melting point , solubility , and others .
3.0	3	2.13.0.0 | Chemical properties however , describe matter based on its ability to change into matter with different properties .
3.0	3	5.8.0.0 | Chemical properties of matter are characterized by their ability to change into a new substance with different properties .
3.0	3	1.6.0.0 | The chemical properties involve changing the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties .
3.1	3	1.7.0.0 | Examples of this are rusting and flammability , .
3.1	3	4.10.0.0 | For example , a chemical property of paper is flammability .
3.1	3	2.14.0.0 | Examples of chemical properties are flammability and rusting , .
3.2	3	2.15.1.0 | , the matter the object is made up of
3.2	3	1.1.1.0 | Matter is what makes up all objects or substances
3.2	3	5.1.0.0 | Matter is all the objects and substances that take up space around us .
3.3	3	2.21.0.0 | The law of conservation of energy is a rule associated with forms of energy .
3.3	3	1.11.0.0 | The law of conservation of energy is the notion .
3.3	3	5.14.1.0 | The rule is known as the law of conservation of energy
3.4	3	3.7.0.1 | that if the physical properties such as the size and shape of an object changes , the chemical properties does not change
3.4	3	2.15.1.1 | The difference between physical and chemical change is that physical change only relates to the size and shape of the object , the matter the
3.4	3	1.4.0.0 | The physical properties are those that can be observed without changing the matter itself .
3.5	3	3.3.5.1 | What is unique is that individuals are able to observe certain forms of matter using their senses while other
3.5	3	2.4.0.0 | Matter can either observed easily with an individual 's senses , or in a more challenging capacity .
3.5	3	4.7.0.0 | A physical property is something we can observe without changing the essential , atomic identity of the matter .
3.6	3	2.26.0.0 | Kinetic energy is the energy an object has .
3.6	3	4.2.0.0 | , we learn the definition of matter , its properties , and matter relates to energy .
3.6	3	5.14.1.1 | that governs energy
3.7	3	4.8.0.0 | For example , its shape , size , malleability , and density are all properties we can observe without fundamentally changing the matter .
3.7	3	5.15.0.0 | This rule indicates .
3.7	3	2.2.0.0 | defines matter as the stuff .
2.0	2	5.17.0.0 | Mechanical energy is the energy of an object that results from its motion or position .
2.0	2	2.24.0.0 | Mechanical energy is the energy an object has because of its motion or position .
2.1	2	2.17.0.0 | Unlike physical change , chemical change occurs the chemical properties of the matter have changed and a new substance is produced .
2.1	2	1.9.1.1 | By changing the physical property of the substance , the matter itself does not change , but in a chemical change the
2.2	2	5.6.0.0 | Physical properties are observed without changing the identity of the object .
2.2	2	2.9.0.0 | Physical properties can be observed without having to change the make-up , or identity of the matter .
2.3	2	2.18.0.2 | , and smoke you 're left with is not paper any longer .
2.3	2	4.11.0.0 | and it is no longer paper .
2.4	2	4.1.0.0 | In What is Matter ?
2.4	2	2.1.0.0 | The author of this passage titled What is Matter ?
2.5	2	2.22.0.0 | This law explains .
2.5	2	3.5.0.0 | The passage further explained .
2.6	2	5.11.1.0 | The difference between a physical and chemical change is that a chemical change will create a new substance while all the chemical properties in a physical change will not change .
2.6	2	3.6.0.0 | Physical properties can occur without changing the identity or nature of the matter .
2.7	2	1.12.0.0 | Mechanical energy is a cause of the object 's motion or position
2.7	2	2.27.0.0 | The author asserts a parallel between speed/mass and kinetic energy , the greater the speed and mass of an object , the greater the kinetic energy .
2.8	2	2.14.0.1 | as the object is no longer made of the same matter
2.8	2	4.3.1.0 | Matter is anything that has mass
2.9	2	3.4.0.0 | The latter requires the assistance of a specific instrument such as a microscope .
2.9	2	2.16.2.0 | The author provides an example of a sheet of paper folded into thirds , although the new paper size is now one third of the original and is shaped
1.0	1	2.5.0.1 | are : rocks , trees , bicycles , and different kinds of animals .
1.1	1	2.5.1.0 | Examples are : rocks , trees , bicycles , and different kinds of animals
1.2	1	2.7.0.0 | Dust mites are too small for the naked eye but can be found in furniture and rugs , and air argues it can be felt with help of the wind , bending the tree branches .

1.20	1	2.12.0.0 | The author references clay as an object that is malleable .
1.21	1	2.12.0.1 | as it has the ability to take different forms by pressing or pounding on it
1.22	1	2.12.1.0 | The author references clay as an object that is malleable as it has the ability to take different forms by pressing or pounding on it .
1.23	1	2.16.3.1 | is now one third of the original
1.24	1	2.18.0.0 | The author keeps the original type of matter : paper
1.25	1	2.20.0.1 | , energy is very essential .
