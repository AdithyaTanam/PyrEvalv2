5.1	5	2.8.0.0 | Matter can be classified by two separate properties : physical and chemical .
5.1	5	3.5.0.1 | that matter can be broken down into physical properties and chemical properties
5.1	5	4.6.0.0 | Scientists classify matter based on its physical and chemical properties .
5.2	5	4.9.0.0 | However , a chemical property requires the observer to change the essential , atomic identity of the matter .
5.2	5	3.7.0.1 | that if the physical properties such as the size and shape of an object changes , the chemical properties does not change
5.2	5	5.11.1.0 | The difference between a physical and chemical change is that a chemical change will create a new substance while all the chemical properties in a physical change will not change .
5.2	5	2.17.0.0 | Unlike physical change , chemical change occurs the chemical properties of the matter have changed and a new substance is produced .
5.2	5	1.9.1.1 | By changing the physical property of the substance , the matter itself does not change , but in a chemical change the
5.3	5	5.13.1.0 | Energy is related to matter because all matter is made up of energy .
