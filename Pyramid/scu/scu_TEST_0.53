4.0	4	2.13.0.0 | Chemical properties however , describe matter based on its ability to change into matter with different properties .
4.0	4	1.2.0.0 | Some types of matter are easily observable with the senses
4.0	4	3.3.3.0 | What is unique is that individuals are able to observe certain forms of matter using their senses while other forms are not so easily observed .
4.0	4	5.10.0.0 | There is also a physical and chemical change that exists in matter .
3.0	3	5.6.0.0 | Physical properties are observed without changing the identity of the object .
3.0	3	3.6.0.0 | Physical properties can occur without changing the identity or nature of the matter .
3.0	3	2.9.0.0 | Physical properties can be observed without having to change the make-up , or identity of the matter .
3.1	3	5.5.0.0 | Physical and chemical properties are the two main types of properties used to classify matter .
3.1	3	1.3.0.0 | To classify matter one must identify the physical and chemical properties .
3.1	3	2.8.0.0 | Matter can be classified by two separate properties : physical and chemical .
2.0	2	2.17.0.0 | Unlike physical change , chemical change occurs the chemical properties of the matter have changed and a new substance is produced .
2.0	2	1.9.1.1 | By changing the physical property of the substance , the matter itself does not change , but in a chemical change the

1.7	1	2.6.0.0 | Types of matter more challenging to observe are : dust mites and air .
1.8	1	2.7.0.0 | Dust mites are too small for the naked eye but can be found in furniture and rugs , and air argues it can be felt with help of the wind , bending the tree branches .

1.22	1	2.12.0.0 | The author references clay as an object that is malleable .
1.23	1	2.12.0.1 | as it has the ability to take different forms by pressing or pounding on it
1.24	1	2.15.0.1 | , the matter the object is made up of remains the same .
1.25	1	2.16.0.0 | The author provides an example of a sheet of paper folded into thirds , and is shaped differently , it is still paper .
1.26	1	2.16.0.1 | although the new paper size is now one third of the original
