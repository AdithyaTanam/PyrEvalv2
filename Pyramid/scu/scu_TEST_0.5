4.0	4	2.13.0.0 | Chemical properties however , describe matter based on its ability to change into matter with different properties .
4.0	4	1.2.0.0 | Some types of matter are easily observable with the senses
4.0	4	3.3.3.0 | What is unique is that individuals are able to observe certain forms of matter using their senses while other forms are not so easily observed .
4.0	4	5.10.0.0 | There is also a physical and chemical change that exists in matter .
3.0	3	5.5.0.0 | Physical and chemical properties are the two main types of properties used to classify matter .
3.0	3	1.3.0.0 | To classify matter one must identify the physical and chemical properties .
3.0	3	2.8.0.0 | Matter can be classified by two separate properties : physical and chemical .
3.1	3	5.13.1.0 | Energy is related to matter because all matter is made up of energy .
3.1	3	2.19.1.1 | , and all matter has it .
3.1	3	4.13.0.1 | , all matter has it .
2.0	2	2.17.0.0 | Unlike physical change , chemical change occurs the chemical properties of the matter have changed and a new substance is produced .
2.0	2	1.9.1.1 | By changing the physical property of the substance , the matter itself does not change , but in a chemical change the
2.1	2	5.6.0.0 | Physical properties are observed without changing the identity of the object .
2.1	2	2.9.0.0 | Physical properties can be observed without having to change the make-up , or identity of the matter .
2.2	2	5.11.1.0 | The difference between a physical and chemical change is that a chemical change will create a new substance while all the chemical properties in a physical change will not change .
2.2	2	3.6.0.0 | Physical properties can occur without changing the identity or nature of the matter .
