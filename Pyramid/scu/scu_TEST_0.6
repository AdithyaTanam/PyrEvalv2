1.69	1	3.7.0.0 | It is important to know .
1.70	1	4.3.1.0 | Matter is anything that has mass
1.71	1	4.3.2.1 | that has mass and
1.72	1	4.4.0.1 | because it does have mass and take up space
1.73	1	4.5.0.0 | Common examples are solids like a bed and a bug , liquids like water and milk , and gas like air and smoke .
1.74	1	5.4.0.0 | Properties are used to help us identify matter .
1.75	1	5.7.0.1 | but the molding does not change the substances in clay .
1.76	1	5.7.1.0 | but the molding does not change the substances in clay
1.77	1	5.9.0.0 | For example , paper burning into ash and irons ability to rust .
1.78	1	5.15.0.0 | This rule indicates .
1.79	1	5.15.1.0 | This rule indicates that energy can not be destroyed it moves from one object or system to another .
