4.1	4	4.1.0.0 | In What is Matter ?
4.1	4	1.1.1.0 | Matter is what makes up all objects or substances
4.1	4	2.2.2.0 | defines matter as the stuff that all objects and substances in the the universe are made of .
3.0	3	5.6.0.0 | Physical properties are observed without changing the identity of the object .
3.0	3	3.6.0.0 | Physical properties can occur without changing the identity or nature of the matter .
3.0	3	2.9.0.0 | Physical properties can be observed without having to change the make-up , or identity of the matter .
3.1	3	2.13.0.0 | Chemical properties however , describe matter based on its ability to change into matter with different properties .
3.1	3	5.8.0.0 | Chemical properties of matter are characterized by their ability to change into a new substance with different properties .
3.1	3	1.6.0.0 | The chemical properties involve changing the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties .
3.2	3	5.5.0.0 | Physical and chemical properties are the two main types of properties used to classify matter .
3.2	3	1.3.0.0 | To classify matter one must identify the physical and chemical properties .
3.2	3	2.8.0.0 | Matter can be classified by two separate properties : physical and chemical .

2.0	2	4.13.0.1 | , all matter has it .
2.1	2	2.17.0.0 | Unlike physical change , chemical change occurs the chemical properties of the matter have changed and a new substance is produced .
2.1	2	1.9.1.1 | By changing the physical property of the substance , the matter itself does not change , but in a chemical change the
2.2	2	1.10.0.0 | All matter has energy , .
2.2	2	4.2.0.0 | , we learn the definition of matter , its properties , and matter relates to energy .
2.3	2	5.1.0.0 | Matter is all the objects and substances that take up space around us .
