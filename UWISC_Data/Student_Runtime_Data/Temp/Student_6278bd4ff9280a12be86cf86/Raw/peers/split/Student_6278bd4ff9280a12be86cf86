The best roller coaster should have an initial drop higher than the hill.
Having the initial drop higher than the hill allows the cart to make it up the hill and to the end.
The data says, if the hills height is the same as the initial drop then the car wont have enough KE to make it over the hill because the KE will be lower than the PE.
An example was the same as the initial drop of cm the car didnt make it to another end because there was a bigger hill.
