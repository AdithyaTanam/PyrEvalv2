Dear, Gonzales family So when my team makes the ID, it has to be higher than all the hills on the track to reach the end of the track.
Initially when I had the ID as m on trial and the hill height as m then the cart wouldnt make it over because it doesnt have enough energy.
So I increased the ID to .m and kept hill height at m and the cart made it to the end at a safe speed .
m s .
There will be friction on the track so its a smooth ride and this makes the ride easier to model because it is basic physics.
So you need to make all the hills lower than the ID.
Height affects PE the higher the ID is or hill is the more PE there is because the PE shows how high energy is in something.
Once the cart starts to move, the kinetic energy grows and the potential energy gets smaller.
I also noticed that if I made the hill too high, the speed was too high.
When on trial , the ID was meters tall and the speed at the bottom of the drop is .
which is unsafe.
Eventually, I found a height that was safe and you can see my measurements below: Top of ID PE J KE J End of track PE J KE J Speed .
